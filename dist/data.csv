Event Name: https:// https://admin.lup.com.au/Event/EventDetail/2527
Event ID: 2527

The client has raised this feedback and we are seeking help if we can -
Add a “Back” button on our online registration page to allow users to easily return to previous steps during the ticket purchasing process. 
This enhancement aims to improve the user journey by enabling visitors to correct errors (e.g., misspelt names, incorrect emails, or wrong mobile numbers) without restarting the entire process. Additionally, this feature should help reduce customer service queries related to updating visitor details.

 Visibility:
 • The “Back” button is clearly visible and accessible on all steps of the registration process where applicable.
 Functionality:
 • Clicking the “Back” button returns the user to the immediately preceding step without losing any previously entered data.
 • The transition does not cause any unexpected behavior or errors.
 • Users are able to modify any information on the previous pages once they navigate back.
 
Additional Notes:
 • This feature is expected to enhance the overall registration experience and decrease the volume of support tickets concerning detail updates.
 
Thank you so much,",Dev BAU Sprint,,,,DEV-3145,

- Is there a ways this can be customised per event (eg using clients artwork or customising it using events hex color?
- If we are using the pay via invoice link is there a way we can have the button as optional only (there might be clients who does not want it display) so I am looking to a possibility of a request coming through if we are asked to remove it.

For events where people can register for delegate passes & gala dinners, the subject line for confirmation emails has to be the same per event or store.
When we are sending out reminder emails closer to event dates, clients ask if we can adjust the subject line of the email to be more specific to the ticket attached to get people's attention.

For example when sending out delegate pass reminder emails we might want ""REMINDER: Delegate Pass Attached here""

Foe example when sending out gala dinner reminder email we might want ""REMINDER: Gala Dinner Ticket Attached here""

Presently if we change the subject line, it changes across the whole event.

Solution
We need a way to edit the subject line of a confirmation email on a per product basis.
Is there a way we could create an event parameter that would allow us to customise the subject line of confirmation emails sent from Admin on a per product basis?

The event parameter would override the default subject line.

For example:
Product ID: 4444 | See below your tickets
Product ID: 5555 | Confirmation below of tickets

This would operate similar to how custom email templates are managed in event parameter.
https://Ticketing_Ticket_Product_Template

This request is being pushed hard by Steve Gibson from AMDA but would benefit so many other clients too.

Steve is going live with Indian Ocean in 3 weeks. Is this possible to achieve by then?

I put together a doc outlining all the emails and subject lines we can customise. The issue is not being able to do it on a per product basis.

Description & Scope:
To prepare for this new feature: The client had the following queries: (so the client can go back to their internal Stakeholders on what's possible to charge and scope):
- Number of vouchers will be shown on digital pass once accreditation has been approved
- When a meal has been redeemed the number will refresh overnight, eg start with 24 vouchers redeem 2 next morning number will change to 22
- A barcode can be scanned up to 4 times per meal break eg I am collecting meal for three other people in the business at the same time as collecting my meal.
- Vouchers can easily be added or removed from a person’s accreditation?


----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

Further to this card after our meeting:
    We will set-up PDF Ticket for the Dome Meal Voucher
    Client advised only RAS Staff will receive (all other pass types to be rolled out in 2027)
    Previously we had discussed to have 12 or 24 Meal Vouchers however there has been an update since from the client
    They will have mixed quantities of voucher numbers that the staff will receive. Some casual staff may have 6 vouchers.
    Can we import the number of vouchers on their behalf with an extra column as per the Accreditation import template or can client still send out after importing and then we back-fill the voucher quantity

Main Packs (Can we still use as it's up to 24 - to cover any other quantities e.g 6, 12 etc?)

this card is to auto create the vouchers addons:

After import was done, I checked some tickets were already registered, with name and email on the ticket.

Reason we decided to the an unregistered ticket import is that, there are some people on the import list will receive multiple tickets. List below:

This creates issues with stand names that require them (for example, many stand names at PBC Events).

The current workaround is to remove the apostrophe, which results in inaccurate stand names and inconsistencies across records.

A permanent solution that ensures apostrophes are fully supported and recognised will:
    Improve accuracy of stand names
    Enhance user experience by removing the need for manual workarounds
    Ensure compliance with the actual and correct stand names

Expected Outcome
    Apostrophes are accepted and displayed correctly in Admin
    Stand names with apostrophes are stored and reported accurately
    Consistency is maintained across databases, exports, and outputs

Example:

Hey Team,
Just sharing this here as well as it relates to 2604 In-Cosmetics Global and stock.
We have an issue with stock controller.
It is counting based on all tickets regardless if they are verified or approved.
So we have had 1 session show as sold out online because 45 people have applied for it and have verification status, but it should only count based on 45 people being approved for the session.
Session in question: https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketProduct/EditTicketProduct/50486
Gem Stonem
https://lupevents.slack.com/team/U1ADZBH7D https://lupevents.slack.com/team/U0GD6JV7S Issue with stock.
This pack was showing as Sold Out online because 45 people had applied for this session. 45 People have verification status, none have been approved. Therefore the session should not show as sold out. It should only count stock based on 45 approved registrants not verified.
I have manually set the capacity to be 0 so the pack is no longer showing as sold out online.

Register Reminder Email - Unregistered Ticket Links to be One Email instead

Due Date:
Dec 19, 2025

Priority:
Normal

Event Code:
2605-The Podcast Show London

Description:
Currently for register reminder email will send 1 email per unregistered ticket, x of xx emails for example. This template here > https://en-template.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/register-reminders/ticket-conf-invoice-link-v2.html

This is somewhat bothering for some orderers where if they have multiple ticket that they ordered under their email, and when register reminder email is sent out, they receive xx number of emails depending on how many unregistered tickets they have. There are already a few organisers requested this before.

Are we able to make a template and/or rule on the system, so that when register reminder email is being sent out, the orderer will only receive one email. And on that one email, it will list down the links of the unregistered tickets instead.

Many thanks

Note:
Once the new templates have been configured we also need to check the Android app WalletPasses due the client recalls that this app version doesn't show the photo ID image?
I've asked if she can advise further or provide the example order that had the issue.

The event uses TicketMaster barcodes (short and longcodes) - RAS would like to break down the Ticketmaster barcodes by individual ticket type for Accreditation. Please see attached the 2026 barcodes files for each ticket type.

These need to be implemented for all registrations at the event

This was done for 2025 and worked well. This needs to be done before we start sending badges, but ideally do all this before we go-live ie someone registers, then our system will update the default LUP barcode to a ticketmaster barcode.

Hi Team

In relation to this card. https://app.asana.com/1/423688738683911/project/1203000475022678/task/1212229351627508?focus=true

Can we please make sure that once the ticket has been updated to Delegate that they are still getting their respective email confirmation email eg 
- if they are a trade visitor then puchased a conference once the system updated their ticket to Delegate, they still need to receive visitor confirmation email and honor the product template on the event parameter.
- Same goes with the Defence visitor

I'd like to apologies first as this is a result of me setting the addons up based on the client's demand and not imposing what our system can do.

On this event there are several addons that was created and I've used the ""name of the room"" as a category instead of using the dates. As a result, the feature where we normally prompt the visitor that their addons have conflicting times with the others are not implemented

Is there a way for us to get a list of visitors with double up sessions so we can send an email communications to let them choose one of the session only.

Client would like to request if the add-on link page can be modified. I understand that the event param only works on add-on page within the Registration journey but if its possible to modify the separate link if they have existing ticket already.


https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1212233886723533

Per client - ""Could we change the title from Purchase Add-On's / Seminars / Workshops > Purchase additional sessions
and the below text from This screen allows you to purchase add-ons/workshops for your existing ticket purchase. > This screen allows you to purchase additional sessions for your existing ticket.

Also is there a little help note we can add under ticket QR code so they know where to find it?

Its more we don’t offer workshops so this is misleading to our visitors. And the language doesn’t match which will also create more confusion.""


Thanks !! 🙂

The client has a discount strategy that is key to their marketing campaign.

For anyone who adds 8 or more tickets to their order, they would like the system to auto apply a 10% discount.

So:
If I select 7 tickets = no discount
If I select 8 tickets = 10% discount applied to total transaction

We need to consider the scenario that someone selects 8 tickets, the discount is applied, but then they remove some tickets and now have less than 8 tickets selected. The discount needs to disappear.

The 10% discount only applies if 8 or more $$$ value tickets are selected.
So if i select 6 x $$$ tickets & 2 x FREE tickets, the discount is not applied.

We need to consider the scenario that the client may still want to use other tracking links / embedded coupon codes, so we need to discuss what options we have around this working in conjunction with these type of codes.

Event | https://admin.lup.com.au/Event/EventDetail/2674
https://tickets.lupevents.co.uk/the-podcast-show-london-2026?cat=cat-registration

We have advised 1st week of December, but if this can be ready sooner it would be really appreciated as we really want to wow this client being our first big client in the UK!

During event setup, the Pack was configured as “Champions Lounge – Thursday”, while the underlying Product was incorrectly set to “Champions Deck – Thursday.” Before this discrepancy was corrected, a total of 68 tickets had already been allocated. Once the configuration was updated, those previously generated tickets became invalid.

This made the affected Tickets have no Main Pack and Main Product in Universal Report.

This card is to add popup windows with wording

I wasn't sure if this was automated from the last event however the client has noticed one of the delegate's their dietary is not appearing when downloaded from the Gala Dinner Seating report. There will be others as well that have advised.

This is a paid event, using client's stripe gateway.
Most payments went through this gateway, however a handful of transactions were handled by the client directly and did not go through lup's ticketing. For these transactions the order was marked as PAID Manually by choosing CASH and adding the value manually.

We are seeing funky numbers in the Console Sales Summary.

Total packs sold is $212,369.30
Total transactions is $190,206.50
This is not adding up correctly
    Could it be we made some packs active without recording a payment?

I only duplicated the event in admin so let me know if I miss anything on the event parameter or anything else. Scan to Win needs to be configured BEFORE ticketing goes live, otherwise tickets will not have the URL on them to access the Scan to Win portal.

A) An event Parameter to turn on - M.lup Digital show bag
B) An event Parameter to turn on - Scan to win Feature
C) An event Parameter to supply template for a text block if has location to still scan -
D) An event Parameter to supply content for a text block if has location all locations have been scanned

The goal is either to:

    Make the Event Information header text to be editable; or:
    If not doable, make the Event Information header to be consistent, even if there is no custom description to it in admin, so it will not just show as ""Venue Information & parking"".

At AusCryptocon we have an issue around ""double entitlements"" and the way products have been set up.

There are some ticket types that INCLUDE access to an INDUSTRY NETWORKING EVENT.

The issue we face with the products that automatically include access to the industry night event is the inability to control access onsite.
If I have a VIP ticket, my entitlements need to allow me to re-enter the expo unlimited number of times. But when I attend the industry night, my ticket can only be scanned once, and the scanner needs to reject my ticket if it is attempted to be scanned again. (This is a concern for the client as they have a history of people taking screenshots of their tickets and sharing it with their friends)

So this card is to automatically add the industry night ADD-ON to the products that have it included so we can set entitlements on these add ons and control access onsite.

Noting here that this card is to bulk add the ADD ON to the products above to all orders previously purchased, and then to be an automatic process for any sales made after this card.

The event runs 21st - 23rd November.

For hydrogen we are going to set up ticketing links for exhibitor badges using eg cat=cat-exhibitor&ExhibitorID=xxxxxxxxxx

eg https://tickets.lup.com.au/apac-hydrogen-summit-and-expo-2025?cat=CAT-EXHIBITOR&ExhibitorID=TEST-ID-FROM-TICKETING-PAGE

    Any registration that has &ExhibitorID=xxxxxx in the URL
    Insert the xxxxxx value in to the Visitor's answer for this question (has SaveTo = ExhibitorID) https://admin.lup.com.au/QuestionDetail/EditQuestionDetail/202758

        and John Smith had 5 different tickets (and 5 different visitor registrations).  
        All 5 of John Smith's registrations should have a value of 1 inserted in the question HotelMarketing into the answerdetails table.

We use the session Mappings table:

    Automatically create the surveyquestions for the SessionCodes if the questions don't exist already
        here is example https://admin.lup.com.au/QuestionDetail/EditQuestionDetail/206033)
        Also Add them to all ProductQuestions as INACTIVE/False
    Use the SessionMappings file to insert them as value of 1 similar to how previous methods did it
    This should be based on Firstname + Lastname + Email, not just longcode, as per previous methods. eg if John Smith john@example.com scanned barcode 1234 at SessionA but John Smith john@example.com also has a ticket 5555 then both of those tickets should have the question inserted in them.

https://admin.lup.com.au/Event/EventDetail/2649

For 2606 NZ Cryptocon they would like to sell their tickets as so:

Main Pack & Product = General Admission
Main Pack & Product = VIP

There is an official after party which is sold as an Add On.

So If i purchase a General Admission Ticket, I have the option to purchase the official after party as an Add On.

However, the Official After Party is INCLUDED in the VIP ticket.

How can we set this up so that the Pack VIP has the Official After Party Add on included in the pack like a bundle? Currently the system won't let us do this.

We need every ticketholder for the official after party to have a specific add on because onsite we will need to set up an entry scanner that only allows the official after party add on, and the entitlements will need to be set to single entry 1 time scan.

Our tickets/get/upgrade system doesn't work if a ticket belongs to a group booking (ie if it was in a pack that had more than 1 ticket)

We need upgrades to work in this scenario.  A potential path is if a ticket from a  multi-ticket pack comes through and wants to upgrade, then we can get the system to split the tickets in to their own packs.

This time, group tickets below will be included. Thank you!

 I’ve updated Melda Kocataskin’s company name on the badge printer scanner. The new information is showing correctly in Admin, and I was able to download her ticket with the updated details.
 However, after refreshing all devices and trying different scanners, the old company name is still appearing on the badge printer.

Just some feedback we've noticed with clients using the Orders Report in Universal Report.

It's confusing to clients that this report does not contain all their ticketholders, it is only the orderer details.
Can we add some text to note this to guide clients?

Or can we review the need for this report?
I'm just trying to simplify our system and go with a ""less is more"" approach given everything they could possibly need is in the other universal reports.

My observations have indicated that clients typically want a csv with all ticketholders not orderers.

ARBS a new client and have a different registration journey in mind as opposed to the standard. If this set up is possible.
Admin - https://admin.lup.com.au/Event/EventDetail/2605
Aiming to get registration ready by end of October ready for launch in November.

Page 1 - Landing Page 
Page 2 - Registration of the main ticket
Page 3 - Seminars (about 80 seminars that will be integrated via API from MapYourShow to LUP)
Page 4 - Industry Awards/Gala dinner (with Dietary Restriction question)

So currently, to allow multiple transactions, Gala placed as an Extra. The client wants the Seminar and Awards to be consecutive pages and Gala dinner tickets include Single Ticket and Table of 10. 

Details from client on regarding Awards that may be essential in deciding options :
1. Should there be a marker on an attendee's name badge that is printed onsite that indicates they are attending the Gala Dinner? 
No, they don’t wear their badges to the dinner as it is a formal occasion.
2. Do you need to know the names of everyone attending the dinner? E.g. if someone purchases a table of 10, do you need to know the individual names of the 10 people attending the dinner?
No, they usually don’t know who is on their table / guests till closer to the event. We follow up with them directly.
3. How are you planning on managing table and seat allocation for the gala dinner? 
We do this manually
4. In addition to question 3, should there be any details passed back to the visitor about which table / seat number that have been allocated?
No, if they ask we just email them personally
5. How have you managed dinner tickets previously? For example, have attendee's had a separate ticket for the dinner or is it included in their main registration ticket?
The dinner is always sold separately. We have used other booking platforms in the past such as try booking but we wanted it all in one place

DEV note: Steps to send Gala SMS
    Use the query attached to this card.
    Ensure the @eventID parameter is set to the correct event,
    Set the @testPhoneNumber parameter to +61482080001  for testing and set it to NULL  when sending to to the actual number.
    Set the @userName parameter to your user email.
    Send only 1 first (use select top 1 in the query) to test with MQDestination to SMS Number +61482080001 , update the related MQueue row to MQStatus= Active, and see the result
    Double check by looking at the query result (select *), comparing Phone vs InternationalPhone, make sure they are match and correct number.
    If #2 resulted incorrect / unexpected result, test sending again from local machine, repeat step #2 until you are sure it's correct.
    manually insert rows to MQueue, with MQStatus as Pending using attached query (this way it doesnt get executed automatically).
    send 1 first for the queued SMS by updating 1 row to be MQStatus='Active'. Check the log.
    If they are ready to be sent, update the related MQueue MQStatus to Active

Looks like Email is done but not sms?


For Gala dinner SMS export, I had to merge the data for the tables so that it is one row for the same phone number

And also a separate merge for the data so that it is one row for the same email address

I also had to include wording in the cells, so it's easy to SMS/email in bulk

It would be good if this is built in so it's easy to export

Neeshil to provide examples

Options:
    Enhance the data export for SMS and Email; or
    Send SMS/Email from inside Admin

Enhance the data export for SMS and Email
    In admin/download we have the Gala download
    Split it in to two, one for Email and one for SMS
    Email should then have multiple columns ([Table1], [table2] etc..) for each row, so that if an Email address has multiple tables, then it puts them in to extra columns
    Same for SMS version, but the columns are when matching the phone number.
    Email version should use the event parameter for that as per below, and the SMS use the SMS parameter as per below.

Proof of concept below



Send SMS/Email from inside Admin

SMS:
    Ability to test and Send Gala SMS from inside Admin
    Needs to work with UK numbers
    Note we have a separate question for mobile country code
    Event parameter for the SMS Gala text: eg  [Firstname] your ticket to the gala dinner can be accessed here [ShortURL] (Table: [Table]). See you tomorrow at the ICC Grand Ballroom, Convention Level 5 at 7pm.
    Note SMS only sends TABLE, not the SEAT
    Add it to the MQUEUE for SMS so it goes via Burst
    IMPORTANT: If a phone number has more than 10 tickets, then do NOT send any to that number
    Testing: Send 10x SMS of random tickets to a specified number
    Products are based on the product attribute of Gala
    Only include ACTIVE tickets (not verification)

Email:
    Ability to test and send Gala Email from inside admin
    Specify a template file in Admin
    EventParameter for the line that has the text [Firstname] [Lastname]'s is seated on table [Table] and their ticket is [ShortURL].

If an addon pack set to be Inactive and there are Active tickets has the addon attached to them, this will cause issue when the ticket owner wants to purchase additional addon.

Suggested solution:
    On Admin, only $0 addon pack that can be set to Inactive/Deleted. If it has related Active tickets attach to it, ask confirmation alert popwindow before updating the status.
    It then also update the TicketOrderPackStatus and TicketOrderProductStatus to Cancelled in all tickets that has the related addon pack.

At events, we sometimes set one survey to scan the whole day in a room.  Later we then want to split the scans of the day in that room, to be specific to a session. eg in SurveyID 123 9am to 10am was OUR HERO, BALTHAZAR, 10:30-11:30 was SHORT FILMS: IFP WATCH PARTY, 1:30 to 2:30 was THE TRUE BEAUTY OF BEING BITTEN BY A TICK

We would like to 'automate' this so we don't have to keep doing custom queries.

So the idea is we can import a session mapping spreadsheet that tells us the surveyID, session name, date/time of start/finish and then we can output this in a simple fashion.

To do:
    Create a SessionMapping table (or whatever you choose to call it)
    Note sessions to products is 1 to 1 
    ProductID is nullable
    Import the data for SXSW
    Creating queries is another card

Ignore the yellow columns as these are derived fields

This card is for the new Live sessions report.  Based on a permission flag.

This card is to configure it and have the placeholder report page working with the right permissions, so we can build the correct direct to expoDB report.

    Create a new permissions flag for a User → Organisation LIVE SESSIONS
    Add this to the User Permissiosn screen. ""Live Sessions"". ""This is for SXSW only and allows the user to see the Live Session attendance and rush ticket sales.  It is hardcoded to work on SXSW only.""
    It will be accessed by a widget tile in the event (widget is text only)
    Only an organiser who has the LIVE SESSIONS permission will see this tile and can access the page

    Click widget go to Live Sessions Page
    Select Session Type list eg Screen, Conference, Music or Other etc (select distinct SessionType from Session Mappings where eventID=2540 Order By SessionType
    Select a date from the list Select distinct SessionDate from SessionMappings where EventID=2540 and SessionType=SelectedSessionType order by SessionDate
    See the sessions list (filtered by the SessionType and SessionDate), grouped by Location, Group by Room, order by SessionStart. Columns
        Session Name
        Location
        Session Start Time
        Session Capacity
        Scanning Start time
        Scanning End time
        SurveyTitle
        Total Rush Ticket Sales (the product linked to the sessionMapping.ticketproductID)
        Total Scans (distinct scan of valid longcodes. eg 32 chars long)
        Seats available (TicketProducts)
        Once that works then also give extra columns for the scan based on TicketProductReportCategory
            eg a Column for each TicketProductCategory, so we can then see of the scans in the door how many were Platinum Rush, Pro Pass etc
            eg select ticketProductID, ticketproductcode, ticketproductreportcategory from ticketproducts where eventID=2540 and TicketProductCategory='standard' order by ticketproductreportcategory
            Qty Platinum Pass Scans
            Qty Screen Pro Pass Scans
            Qty Screen Wristband Scans
            Qty Rush Tickets Scans
            Qty Music, Games and T & I Pro Pass Scans
        If there is no SurveyID on a session then write ""No survey linked to this session"" (or similar) on that row
    Clicking the session code should take you to detail page
        At the top include:
            Session Code
            Session Name
            Session Date, Starting Time

Sometimes people have very long names or company names or positions and then this messes up the layout for the badges.


For Plastic Badge printing and Colour Badge printing, TicketPDF we have merge fields for

    VisitorFirstName
    VisitorLastName
    Company
    Position

But because the word merge doesn't support dynamic font sizing, we encounter issues when the name is long or company is long.

As this has been accounted for last year this is a place-holder card in case we will have issues with merge fields.
Testing will begin early September so further information will be added to this card as required - TBA

We set up ticketing for SXSW differently this year for Pro Passes.

Last year we had created unique products for each Pro Pass (exmaple: pro pass - music, pro pass - screen, pro pass - games)

This year we set pro passes up as 1 product: Pro Pass, and set the different pass types as Add Ons.
So I register for a Pro pass and I have an add on where i choose music, screen or games.

Unfortunately when we launched ticketing we did not consider that this would impact our ability to set up a unique colour badge layout per product by having the same product.

So we need the system to allocate the colour badge layout based on their add ons for Pro Passes to print and based on the colour badge pdf template in each add on.

See badge templates set up and tested already

Title of the task:
SXSW Server Load expectations


Priority:
Normal

Description:
Hi Dev team. Please note we will creating many surveys, adding thousands and products to surveys and ticket steam which always cause high server loads. If we can have something to turn off in the system to not cause this surge whilst we set up all our entitlements and surveys. We will start doing this on the week of September 22 after the last September event (OFD Melbourne on Sep 21) where there will be no events running for that week.

Proposed solution:
    Hardcode in the system that this event only will not add to ticket stream when adding/deleting/removing products from a ticket survey
    Production team can then do their work. 
    Once work is completed by Thursday 9th October hard code can be removed
    Dev team 'do something' to make the ticketstreams get populated in a non-cripple the system manner.

Where to do this:
    On https://admin.lup.com.au/Survey/SurveyQuestions/59794?eventID=2540 Add/remove products from survey https://admin.lup.com.au/Survey/SurveyQuestions/59794?eventID=2540
    Also the ticket stream handler, should ignore if tickets are on this event for now

The challenge we now face is that for Pro Pass - Talent we need a T to display in the badge text. But for the other Pro Pass Products, we need to badge text to be BLANK / NULL. The system won't let us do this. It is displaying VISITOR as this is the default.

For when the system calculated Badgeline text, currently it is hardcoded that if there is no badgeline value on the product. eg it is NULL or blank string, then it defaults to VISITOR. 

Can we remove this permanently from all events? And treat it as blank or null means make it blank or null.

Also note that this means if a record has VISITOR as badgetext but now the product is saying it should be NULL then when we update it the badgeline text should become blank

We have discovered that the way we initially set up the packs and products for some tickets will not work onsite when managing access control.

These tickets relate to the tech & innovation expo which are day specific. For anyone purchasing an innovation Expo Day Pass for Wednesday, Thursday or Friday choose their day by selecting an Add On.

Saturday is sold separately as it's own day, therefore we did not have a ""Saturday"" Add on set up as there is no need to choose Saturday. The ticket is sold as Saturday Only.

The Innovation Expo Day Pass and Innovation Expo Day Pass Saturday main packs were linked to the same ""Innovation Expo Pass"" Product, which means we have no way of excluding these people on the entry scanner if they try to enter the innovation expo on Wednesday - Friday with their Saturday ticket.

So we want to update those with the Saturday pack to change their product to the correct Saturday main product.

The organiser would like 2 x of their Screen team to only access Rush Ticket sales reports (nothing else). They would like a live data feed rather than wait post-show for this information or wait for an export during event. They check multiple times a day. Can we create a custom access or login to only view the Rush Ticket sales report?

So when they log in they can only see the Screen Product sales (below screen-shot from 2024 sales)

For SXSW when onsite, some people can go straight to express queue to badge print because they have registered the ticket and have the photo on their ticket.

Others can not.

When we send out the Ticket PDF it would be great if the PDF could tell them if they can go to express queue then it's easy for onsite staff to direct people to the correct queue.

Is there a way we can put something on the PDF ticket eg ""EXPRESS QUEUE"" that shows only if they are registered + photo ? In a way that's not too hacky?

Can we please increase the font size of the company (similar to vartext 1 size) and name (slightly smaller than that)

When the company is long it goes onto a second line - this is great but we font size decreases, can it maintain a larger font size. When the first/last name is long it does not go onto a second line but just gets smaller in font size, can we have it go onto a second line and maintain a larger font size (like the company)

Shift the whole badge layout down - we want to move the current qr code up to line up with the vartext 1 line (as we don't require this vartext anymore)

2507 Tactic Conference
https://admin.lup.com.au/Event/EventDetail/2511
The booking fees & taxes were set up incorrectly and amended after ticketing went live.
This event is allowing customers to pay via invoice.
Questions:
    What happens to the outstanding invoices? Will they still be charged the price that was available when they purchased or will the system not change their amount owing based on the current booking fees?

The time and date we changed the booking fees & taxes
 - 24 March, 9am AEST

The booking fees that were in place prior (the incorrect fees):
Fee amount: 1.65
Fee Tax: 0.15
Fee Percentage 2.5%

New, current updated bookings fees:

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1209770279354419


We require an export of all transactions made prior to  24 March, 9am AEST from the time ticketing went live on :

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1209770279354421


The export is to assist us in reconciling financial reports, understand if we owe all customers a refund and how much for each transaction.

Essentially we need to know:
Who bought a ticket
How much did they pay with the old booking fees and taxes?
How much would they have paid with the current booking fees?
What is the discrepancy?",Dev BAU Sprint,,,,DEV-3170,

Currently the customer service team just updates a person's email and name and phone, which isn't ideal.

Also this doesn't flow to the API correctly for external systems like Hubspot via Integrate API.



As integrator
When we 'transfer' a registration to a new visitor this needs to go through API correctly
So that my integration can update appropriately

As a paid delegate to the show
I want to be able to easily send someone else in my place
So that I don't lose money

As customer service
I want to easily transfer someones registration to a new person, adhering to business rules
So that I can follow security practices/requirements and API integration requirements easily


Gotchas:
    Deregister ticket, is it removing ticket.visitorID and updating visitor.barcode nad visitor.longcode to new ones and the existing ticketshortcode and ticketlongcode stays the same?
        What happens with existing scans? does that go with the old record or the new ones? (keep scans with the ticket, not the original registrant)
        Implications with new code that is building allocating an online order with orphaned regstrations?
    Reissue ticket functionality in admin: xyz?
    Transfer ticket functionality


So we want to do this more correctly:
1: Cancel old ticket and create new ticket (including values)
2: Integrate API should be updated automatically to reflect the cancellation.  (Ideally the old ticket is shown as 'Transferred' so the API can handle it accordingly)
3: New ticket is registered with m.lup

Step 1: Cancel old ticket and create new ticket  See implementation below on https://app.asana.com/1/423688738683911/task/1209736188374617/comment/1211178727044261?focus=true
    In admin/ticket in the ticket sub-tab we should in the drop down have a TRANSFER option next to the ticket if it is an ACTIVE or VERIFICATION ticket on an ACTIVE (or TEST) order
        eg on this dropdown

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1211137687850082

    The selected ticket will be cancelled 
        and ticketorderpacks, ticketorderproducts, coupons???) but leave the ticketorder and ticketordertransaction active
        What happens with the old visitor record? What happens with the old visitor Status?
    New (unregistered) ticket is created in the same order with the same packs and add-on packs (and products)
        These should basically be a copy of the old ticket/ticketorderpack/coupon etc
    If the product requires security checks then the ticket status should be Verification, regardless of if the source ticket was already approved
    The value of the new ticket and it's packs matches the old cancelled tickets
    The overall value of the order remains the same
    The total number of active tickets remains the same
    Be sure to test this for orders that have coupons etc

Step 2: API
    Is there anything we can do with articulating in the API that this cancellation was due to a 'Transfer'?

Step 3: Register the new ticket
    The user will register the New ticket is registered either immediately or shortly after
    This should go through API normally and no additioanl work required

I am doing some badge test to 2511 - Indo Pacific

I'm not sure what has happened, but the layout has been adjusted since and is now different to the agreed layout.

My theory is that whilst trying to make the Print@Home Badge layout match the Onsite layout, it has been tweaked.

It's cutting the badge text or the QR code (see some examples attached).

The issue is Steve ordered badge artwork for all events earlier in the year based on those badge specs and now the onsite badge layout is too spread out and prints over the artwork.
I have attached the original spacing for the layout from 2311 IndoPacific.

Printing begins next September 20th in Canberra, where does not have a LUP staff to print and test, so ideally if layout is updated by September 22th.

In IMARC, we want users who have not yet submitted a photo to upload it.

We need to check:
    Do all products that need the photo have it added
   - As per client and the same as last year we are only sending to products that are in Verification stage. And not to Active Tickets (there is exception)

For SpEx Delegate Product we didn't have the Photo ID question added which should have been. Please include all these products regardless of status as they need a photo uploaded.

2. Get a list of who doesn't have the photo and send a request
3. Will the system work also for those who do not have it as ASK LATER? ie sometimes we do an import, so we don't get the photo, but we want to still ask them
4. Because the products have approval required TRUE, does that mean if the ticket is not verification status, then they can't upload their photos?

Also Exclude:

Hi Team,

Admin - https://admin.lup.com.au/Event/EventDetail/2621

I only noticed today that the Payment Gateway Setting for this event was under _LUP2 AU TIX STRIPE instead of the Organiser Stripe. Not sure if this has been the case for couple of days now but I just re-visit the admin and and saw it.

This has been changed back to Organiser's stripe already. Accounts team has been informed. Stripe account showing transactions such the testing initially made in August. Event went live last August 18 but no tickets were captured.

Can this be reviewed how it changed in Admin? or what went wrong. I can't recall changing it and no advisory from Organiser.

The client has advised they will be sending their 1st Gala Dinner import for both Tables of 10 and Single seats.
She's advised for both that most likely we will be importing the Orderer's details first and then send out the Register Reminder email to register the Ticket Holder their gala dinner tickets later.

Currently Importer v2 doesn't support this as yet. Based on this slack https://lupevents.slack.com/archives/C08U9RPAWNA/p1755836520017589?thread_ts=1755591714.018399&cid=C08U9RPAWNA

The client did advise they will aim to send us the final information such as movie titles and confirmed timings by 8th August - if preferred to do the final import around then. We can just work on script etc prior.

Event: 2509 AusFitness Expo & AusFitness Industry
Client: National Media
For both events, we are taking payments onsite with a square terminal.
For AusFitness Expo
    We are taking payment on square terminal, adding the qr code number from the onsite qr code ticket into the notes section of the transaction on the square terminal, so post event, we can match every onsite ticket with a transaction from square.

How are we best to do this for AusFitness Industry?
Context: the visitor will register their details on an iPad and print a badge. Badges do not show their qr code number so we are not able to record this the same way we can for AusFitness Expo.
What is the best approach to this?

Due Date:

Priority:
Normal

Description:
In an event sometimes a single person may have multiple tickets (badges), and some addons are on one badge and not the other. We want as default that all their addons shown on the printed badge, regardless of which ticket the addon belongs to

Note: This only effects the visual on the badges, it does NOT effect the ticket stream. So if they scan the badge that technically doesn't have the addon product added to it, then it will come up as UNRECOGNISED message


If someone has multiple badges, have their addons show on all the badges not just the one.

eg  John, Smith, john@example.com as two registrations:
    DELEGATE has GOLF and GALA
    And EXHIBITOR has NETWORKING

Then printing either badge should have

    GALA GOLF NETWORKING on either badge that gets printed


This should be enabled by default when doing an event with badgelines.

An event parameter to disable this if needed.

Hey, team!
Something is wrong with the report numbers when we are checking on console. The numbers are showing under TICKET ONSITE section for Saturday and is also split and showing the numbers for Gate Adult/Gate Child etc but for Friday it is only showing under TICKET ONSITE and not for the specific ticket type purchased.

https://admin.lup.com.au/Ticket?o=11403684


https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1211051820774694


Currently on the Active Products the htmls are set to zzz'd status and not sent until later (part of the email process) so if Beacon try to resend, Mqueue fails to send
https://admin.lup.com.au/EventParameter/Edit/11995
Only htmls that are set in Verification can still be sent or resent.
https://admin.lup.com.au/EventParameter/Edit/11998

For this order https://admin.lup.com.au/Ticket?o=11729341
it seems this is an import and NOSIC has Approved. Email Send is failed. There will be cases like this as well that won't be able to receive their email.

Currently we are manually uploading the template, then send and then set it back to zzz in the event parameter and is not an efficient process for us or the client.

Is there a way for a script to run regularly to look for those 'Accepted' products that have had Mqueue email fail and to send the Confirmation email?

If this can be worked on or advise another way to resolve this issue that would be greatly appreciated.
Many thanks

For this event the duplicate email check was meant to be on and was only turned on a week ago. For the SXSW App it requires a unique email to create a profile and log in with.

Please isolate and export the duplicates as a csv file.
CSV file will have columns for:

> [TicketOrderName],[TicketOrderEmail],[Ticket1],[Ticket2],[Ticket3],[Ticket4],[Ticket5],[Ticket6],[Ticket7],[Ticket8],[Ticket9],[Ticket10]


and the value of the [Ticketx] columns will be:
<li>{TicketFirstname} {TicketLastname}'s ticket ({OrderID}/TicketShortCode) is {TicketEmail} </li>

E.g john@xample.com has 2 tickets with that email then ticket1, ticket2 columns will be populated like example above.  and ticket3.. ticket10 will be empty

ticket1 column: <li>John Smith's ticket ({12456/32321}) is john@example.com </li>
ticket2 column: <li>Sally Smith's ticket ({12456/32323}) is john@example.com </li>

That way we have the OrderID and QRCODE handy to make it easier to update

We will send an email via campaign monitor so they can advise their email address.

As Organiser
I want people who were security cleared last year to be auto-approved this year
So that it saves time and money in security approvals process

After someone registers the system should check:
    If it is ""verification ""status
    And not in a list of 'dont auto-approve' products
    Email address is not a throaway email or generic email (eg hotmail, QQ, gmail etc)
    Email address domain is not:
        Lup.events
        https://lup.com.au
        https://beaconevents.com
        https://amda.com.au
    Event has enabled ""Auto-verification""
    Check active tickets on active orders from linked events that had been through a verification process
    Update the status
    If in previous year it was security approved 
    If there are multiple years records that were security approved just use most previous year 
    Send the ticket email again (Auto-verification setup should have this on / off)

Checking the above needs to be in place as we have set the relevant Auto Approve Event Parameters https://admin.lup.com.au/EventParameter/EventParameterList/2551

I did notice the below record didn't come up as Approved even though it was Approved from last year. Please cross-check:

As security company
I want to easily know if I approved this registrant last year
So that I can more quickly and effectively process approvals

For security approval events such as AMDA and IMARC, many visitors return year on year.

It would be useful for the security company, when viewing a person this year, to see a summary of what their previous registrations (for this client only), if they were rejected or approved.  (Note only for registrations that were actively went through approval process. If it was 'active' because they were an import or didn't require approval process, don't show this)

It will match on Firstname + Lastname + Email

AND/OR the face signature of this registrations photo vs ANY registration in the system for that client - we should show the approval status for previous years, and also highlight if the name or email is different. To assist with security process. (Can be separate card if need be)

Also it should show if there any from this year approved or rejected as well

This page: https://admin.lup.com.au/Organiser/Accreditation/Index/2c28eff7-5e8b-4df7-98e9-9943f779821c

I see this is in place for this year however I noticed the below sample this one is Auto Approved but there's no text and when I look him up in the
2024 event he is approved so there should be text for this year too.. Please check if this is working correctly.

    Deregister ticket, is it removing ticket.visitorID and updating visitor.barcode nad visitor.longcode to new ones and the existing ticketshortcode and ticketlongcode stays the same?
        What happens with existing scans? does that go with the old record or the new ones? (keep scans with the ticket, not the original registrant)

Gemma: Sold Out not working (or i have not done it properly and need help).
All tickets need to display as sold out (excluding onsite)
I marked all as -1
I checked the ticket page and all were sold out.
Now they are back up online

Lilis Ramadhani discovered that after the first time, Gemma set them to -1, there were still some stock hold reservations, and when they expired, it returned back the reserved stock to the qty available, making it > -1 and allowing the products to sell again.
https://lupevents.slack.com/archives/C028C5GDW49/p1691291804017059?thread_ts=1691289368.570549&cid=C028C5GDW49

Additional Requirement for DEV:
Please also check all related repos to respect the QTY capacity number when calculating the qty inventory/available

Created from Slack: https://lupevents.slack.com/archives/C028C5GDW49/p1691289368570549?thread_ts=1691289368.570549&cid=C028C5GDW49

Steps:
    on TicketProduct's edit page, instead of user set the qty available to -1 to make it sold out, 
        Put a SOLD OUT button next to the QTY Available number field. SOLD OUT button will calculate and set the QTY Capacity based on the current QTY available and QTY inventory numbers. i.e. QTY Capacity = sold number, set all stock hold to be expired, QTY available = -1.
        All changes to TicketProdutc's field have to be logged to the Log table.
        Question for CS/event builder team: is there any event documentation that record the QTY capacity / QTY Available number of the products of an event?

2. On Admin Refund, Admin ChangePack, Ticketing Upgrade,  check if admin/ticketing raising the TicketReturned event correctly and check if GalenErso service read and process it correctly.
i.e. :
        Check if QTY Capacity is set for the old product. 
            If it doesn't set, check if the QTY Available is -1 (sold out). If the QTY Available is sold out, do not put back (add by 1) the QTY Available of the old product.
            If it's set (QTY Capacity > 0) and qty available > 0, calculate current product used number (sold + available + held) vs QTY capacity, if product used number < QTY Capacity, update qty available by +1 ( will need to check if update also needed for the qty inventory), otherwise do nothing.
            If it's set (QTY Capacity > 0) and qty available < 0 (-1), calculate current product used number (sold + available (0) + held) vs QTY capacity, if product used number < QTY Capacity, update qty available to be 1 (as it was -1/sold out previously), otherwise do nothing.
3. When Checking stock holds in GalenErso service, 
        Check if QTY Capacity is set for the old product. 
            If it doesn't set, check if the QTY Available is -1 (sold out). If the QTY Available is sold out, return false
            If it's set (QTY Capacity > 0) and qty available > 0, calculate current product used number (sold + available + held) vs QTY capacity, if product used number < QTY Capacity, return (stock requested <= qtyCapacity - productNumber).
            If it's set (QTY Capacity > 0) and qty available < 0 (-1), calculate current product used number (sold + available (0) + held) vs QTY capacity, if product used number < QTY Capacity, return (stock requested <= qtyCapacity - productNumber). return false

This way, even if the QTY Available > 0 but if the product used number exceeds the QTY capacity, it will prevent/failed the stock hold request.


4. Check TicketReturned event raised by refund. https://admin.lup.com.au/Ticket?o=9071644 there were 2 x SUN Adult refunded, but there were 4 TicketReturned event that processed by GalenErso

I need to upload more than 200 characters on the last question for the scanner below: 
https://admin.lup.com.au/Survey/SurveyQuestions/58004?eventID=2602

Below are the questions that I need to upload: 

1: Yes, this portal is compliant with the various state requirements, our system will ensure each kit is
code compliant, each kit will be displayed in green indicating an audit is not yet due, orange is due
now and red is overdue.
2: Yes, a parent business can have any number of departments or branches setup under the one
account. Approved users can see the status of any kit at any location or department to view the
status of each First Aid Kit. Nominated users can be assigned to their own group so only certain kits
are viewable. Restrictions can be placed for a user to only have the authority to place quotes,
approved users can authorise a quote and convert it to an order.
3: Email reminders will be sent to the nominated auditors advising of an upcoming audit, the system
will email Audit sheets with the kit name and contents to start an audit, if no action has been taken,
we are able to email a supervisor to advise of this.
4: Yes, we have very strong management tools that allow an authorised user to email a detailed
report on items that has been replenished to each kit, this is particularly handy to see highly
consumed items or possible shrinkage to any kit, this detailed report will show the location, what
items have been ordered to each kit, the cost of the item and a total cost of sales to each kit.
5: our WHS compliant portal is absolutely FREE to all of our customers, you only pay for the items
purchased to each kit, our easy to follow First Aid Kit Wizard will allow you to setup your existing kits
and names for easy identification for when goods arrive to your nominated location.

I need to upload it here:

We did this about 10 years ago on previous version of the app and it worked.

Ie if the camera view goes black currently we can swipe the title bar to get in to the app settings then go BACK and it is now working.  So can we ‘automate’ that to happen and test it.


Report from the onsite team across 5 events.
Lüp App (The Internal one we use on Lüp hardware).
Screen goes black and freezes ceasing all functionality with no warning whilst in use by Exhibitors / Staff.
Issue is resolved with closing and re-opening the app.

this is the console view from the checkout page, ""Facebook Pixel: No valid ""ecommerce"" object found in dataLayer""


https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1210271970669222




I asked Chat GPT for some assistance on this error ""Facebook Pixel: No valid ""ecommerce"" object found in dataLayer""

this was the prompt. 
I'm having an issue tracking purchases in Facebook via Google Tag manager, The value of purchases is reporting in GA4, but it is not reporting directly in Facebook, we are getting this error in the chrome tools console, ""Facebook Pixel: No valid ""ecommerce"" object found in dataLayer"" This is the page where we are seeing the issue: https://tickets.lup.com.au/Payment/Checkout/2561 We have a Data layer variable set up in tag manager for Currency, transaction ID and value, Can you please investigate and offer any solutions that we can try. 

one of it's suggestions is: 
Look for an object similar to:

javascriptCopyEdit{
  event: ""purchase"",
  ecommerce: {
    transaction_id: ""123456"",
    value: 89.00,
    currency: ""AUD""
  }
}


If there’s no ecommerce object, Facebook’s tag won’t work properly.

As I hinted earlier, this is the data layer for begin_checkout (the purchase event is likely to be the same

{
  event: ""begin_checkout"",
  gtm: {uniqueEventId: 5, start: 1747343932312},
  eventModel: {
    currency: ""AUD"",
    value: ""$67.38"",
    coupon: """",
    items: [
      {
        item_id: ""39364"",
        item_name: ""FRI - Adult (18+ yrs)"",
        item_category: ""Ticket"",
        price: ""30"",
        quantity: 1,
        index: 0,
        item_variant: ""General Admission Friday""
      },
      {
        item_id: ""39364"",
        item_name: ""FRI - Adult (18+ yrs)"",
        item_category: ""Ticket"",
        price: ""30"",
        quantity: 1,
        index: 1,
        item_variant: ""General Admission Friday""
      }
    ]
  }
}

Facebook is expecting to see ecommerce where eventModel is placed. 
I had tested with eventModel and ecommerce in the tags, The GA4 ones have eventModel and we are seeing values reported, but I'm unsure if your built in integration needs to have the variables for it to report values? 
I had eventModel variable for value and currency as the are required by Facebook and it didn't report anything in Facebook, then switched to ecommerce.value to test and haven't seen any results either in facebook. 
conclusion, is in your data layer, to be consistent with other platforms (eg, shopify and woocommerce) should the data layer use ecommerce instead of eventModel

The client has been checking their Universal Trade reports. Have some queries please:
For reference the trade file: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oOMThMDfh9iGKw3of7y9L_stqIPd7xNxZ13tBE9OvKI/edit?gid=1432611438#gid=1432611438
    For registrant Stuart.Sim@Bain.com he appears on two rows. One which is Approved - 3 Day Delegate pass and one in verification. For the second one it seems a Testcoupon code was used and there's quite a few packs registered with. Is that how all the packs have been registered with?

Query from me: Do we need to keep the second row if the first row has been Approved and is TRUE. It confuses the organiser.

    In the file there is two registrants at the top (you will need to clear the filter from the file) and seems to have incomplete data downloaded. What are the statuses of these two?

We do have an event in Admin for https://admin.lup.com.au/Event/EventDetail/2307 however, we only imported all the data into the system, so we don't have the registration time and date stamp on these records.

due there are other questions needed for the import
    Let us know when imported and which question is the datetime and dev will update the ticketorderdatetime etc.

"1209932494784493",2025-04-09,2025-07-28,2025-07-28,lup.to short url rebuild,Close,Mono Fadhilah,mono.fadhilah@lup.events,,2025-05-30,BAU #5 7/5-13/5,"# URL Shortener Service Specification

## Overview
The goal is to build a scalable, high-performance URL shortener service with logging and statistics capabilities. The system should handle high loads and provide detailed tracking of URL usage. Additionally, it must support migration of existing short URLs from an Azure storage account.


https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1210180955539325



## Key Features

### 1. URL Redirection
- **Redirection Engine**: Use Amazon S3 as the redirection engine.
 - Activate ""website hosting"" on the S3 bucket.
 - Create an empty object for each short URL (case-sensitive random 5-character ID in a folder with a single char & ensure it is already not in use) with a policy to delete it after 365 days.
 - Attach ""website redirect"" metadata with the target (long) URL.
 - S3 will automatically respond with an HTTP redirect to the target URL when the short URL is accessed.

### 2. Domains
- **Primary Domains**:
 - `a.lup.to`: Handles GET requests for redirection.
 - `https://api.ap.lup.events/linkshortener`: A .NET microservice for all other endpoints.

### 3. API Endpoints
#### a. Create Short URLs
1. **POST /create**
  - **Purpose**: Create a new short URL for an event.
  - **Input**:
    - API Key (trusted, machine-to-machine calls, using existing identity approach check clientId is 1,  pass to admin && ticket the api key via env variable).
    - Event GUID (optional).
    - Batch ID (optional).
  - **Requirements**:
    - Must be quick and handled in-process, if there are 500k messages in the bus must still be not affected.
  - **Output**:
    - `201 Created` with the following JSON response:
      ```json
      {
       ""shortUrl"": ""https://a.lup.to/g/abc12""
      }
      ```

2. **POST /bulk**
  - **Purpose**: Create multiple short URLs for an event.
  - **Input**:
    - User Token (less trusted, end-user calls).
    - Event GUID (optional).
    - Batch ID (optional).
  - **Requirements**:
    - Validate user token.
    - Fire off commands via a message bus.
    - Return a `jobId` for tracking.
  - **Output**:
    - `200 Accepted` with the following JSON response:
      ```json
      {
       ""jobId"": ""job-id""
      }
      ```

#### b. Update Short URLs
- **PUT /update**
 - **Purpose**: Admin-only endpoint to edit existing short URLs.
 - **Input**:
   - Admin credentials.
   - Short URL key.
   - New target URL.

#### c. CRUD Operations
1. **GET /batches**
  - **Purpose**: Paginated list of batches.

2. **GET /short-urls**
  - **Purpose**: Paginated list of short URLs.
  - **Filters**:
    - By event.
    - By job ID.
    - By event + batch.

#### d. Statistics
- **GET /stats**
 - **Purpose**: Retrieve usage statistics.
 - **Filters**:
   - By event.
   - By batch.
   - By shorturl.
 - **Implementation**:
   - Use S3 Server Access Logs, AWS CloudTrail, or CloudFront access logs to track hits.
   - Set up a cron job to pull logs every hour and update usage data.

### 4. Migration
- **Purpose**: Migrate existing short URLs from an Azure storage account to the new system.
- **Implementation**:
 - Create a live cron job to pull old short URLs from Azure.
 - Load them into the new system via a command that allows setting the key.

### 5. Requirements
- **Case Sensitivity**: Ensure short URLs are case-sensitive.
- **Short URL Format**:
 - Old format: `https://lup.to/gH0Ty66`
 - New format: `https://lup.to/g/0Ty66`
 - First two characters (`g`) are fixed for a deployment e.g., this service is running in `au` we might say we want everything in bucket `a`.

### 6. Logging
- **Purpose**: Track when a URL is used.
- **Implementation**:
 - Use S3 Server Access Logs, AWS CloudTrail, or CloudFront access logs.
 - Store logs for analysis and reporting.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Must handle high loads instantly.
- **Performance**: Machine-to-machine API calls must be processed in real-time.
- **Security**:
 - API Key for trusted calls.
 - User Token for less trusted calls.
 - Admin-only access for update operations.

## Deliverables
1. Fully functional URL shortener service.
2. Documentation for API endpoints.
3. Migration worker for existing short URLs.
4. Logging and statistics collection system.
5. Unit and integration tests for all features.

## Additional Task
- **Timebox**: Please allocate one day to implement and test the behavior where:
 - If the URL matches the pattern `https://lup.to/gH0Ty66`, it should check in the `lgylinks` storage account.
 - If the URL matches the pattern `https://lup.to/g/0Ty66`, it should check in the `newlinks` storage account.
 - Use CloudFront with Lambda@Edge to route requests based on these patterns.

## Notes
- Refer to the following AWS blog posts for additional context:
 - [Build a Serverless Private URL Shortener](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/build-a-serverless-private-url-shortener/)
 - [Building a Serverless URL Shortener App Without Lambda (Part 1)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-a-serverless-url-shortener-app-without-lambda-part-1/)

Warning for orders that are not set up correctly.

Due Date:
Jul 18, 2025

Priority:
High - 7 days

Event Code:
All events

Description:
For a scanner order to be set up properly it needs to be:
    Linked to a ClientID
    UserID
    One or more active SurveyID created
    Sent to Xero (?)

https://admin.lup.com.au/Order/Master

Perhaps under the Company name we can have in red:
Incomplete: Client, user, Survey, Xero

(But only show the words client, user,survey,xero as needed)

Additional info from Lawrence

When an order has been placed for a scanner it shows as greyed out in admin. When it has been set up (client linked, user set up, survey created invoice sent) it shows as green. However it only shows green when a client is link. We don't know the rest unless we go into each order that it has been set up correct. 

Can we get some sort of warning on the orders link if part of it has been set up. E.g either of the below hasn't been done.
client linked, user set up, survey created, invoice sent)

Description:
For visitor registrations that opt in to flight centre, we need to check/fix the quality of the data

This is to manually update the visitor records to ensure we comply

For anyone who has opted in to Flight Centre opt-in, we need to have two things:
    List of visitors who's data isn't clean as per Flight Centre standards
    Update those visitors to be clean as per Flight Centre standards


Cleanliness rules:
Only for those who have opted in to Flight Centre questions:

Visitor.Firstname, Visitor.Lastname:
    Only allow characters:
        a...z 
        A..Z
        space

        apostrophe `
        ampersand &
        full stop .
        Brackets ( )
    Any other characters should be removed
        Double check if any other characters should be included in this)
    All 5 types of hyphens should be standardised

Visitor.Postcode
    Step 1: For AU and NZ events if it has non-numeric characters clean out the non-numeric characters
    Step 2:
        AU and NZ events must have 4 numeric characters only. 
        If not 4 numeric digits then make it empty

Visitor.Phone
    Remove all non-numeric characters
    Australian events, if it does not start with 61 then drop the leading 0 and add a prefix of 61
    NZ events if it does not start with a 64 then drop the leading 0 and add a prefix of 64
    Aus / NZ events prefix it with +

Visitor.Email
    Ensure it is a valid email address according to RFC standard.
    Do we clean it if it is not or leave it as is?

Upon requeuing badge lines found there was an issue why company/position were empty from importing data via v2 Console.

We need to fix the badge line service so it will not set the company/position to empty.

The bug issue if the event has Fudd_UpdateCompanyAndPostionBasedOnSaveTo set to active/True and visitor didnt answer the company/position questions.

Also kindly advise if we can determine when did the feature stopped working and if we can send the referral emails to those who have registered (including imports) from the time it stopped working.

Here is the live link if you need to test the referral program, choose the GA Free ticket.

Potential Security Issue:
• The ensure ticketing site is duplicated in order to support PDF generation.
• Should the PDF site not be updated as often as either the tickets site, the PDF site may be vulnerable to security issues that were otherwise patched on the Tickets site.
• Should the PDF VM operating system and IIS platform not be updated in line with Microsoft Azure Apps, which is likely not even possible, the underlying infrastructure may be vulnerable to exploits that are addressed on the Azure IIS App.
• A second site with access to the underlying databases and holding all the same access keys doubles the attack surface area of the application, if not more where the second site is a VM.

Recommendation:
• Migrate PDF generation to support Web Apps, in line with the rest of the applications.
• This is based on the assumption that any effort to reduce access to the non-PDFs aspect of the website would be better spend addressing the issue that results in the need for a VM over Serverless Infrastructure.","Dev BAU Sprint,Dev Infrastructure Sprint",,,,DEV-1108,

Ticketing: Promo code 'remove' button

Due Date:
Jun 24, 2025

Priority:
Normal

Event Code:
2509-AusFitness Sydney

Description:
Ticketing: When a promo code is added (or added via URL) the customer needs an easy way to remove the promo code

eg Remove link  below the CouponCode Description is one option

    Pressing remove either removes it from the current order and/or removes it from the URL


https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1210459968397805






At the moment our system only allows one promo code to be used and you can not remove it once it has been added. Jody wants the option for you to remove a promo code and replace it with another one (i.e. would be good to have a little ""x"" in the green box), at the moment you need to leave the ticketing page, come back (and hope it still doesn't have the existing promo code attached still) before you can add another promo code.

Specific to National Media and Fitness - they add tracking codes (which do not give a discount) to the end of every campaign AND promo codes for different exhibitors, sponsors, etc. Ideally they want to be able to do both but Jody understand its a limitation of ours, however she has requested that visitors are at least able to remove the automatic code
Is this in the pipeline / possible - we go live end of this month

Organiser is analysing data of promo code usage per storefront and has come across some discrepancies.

Trade https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16217oekVURizZk7c5aolVH3AO2AoI9DXhNd8tL7L6gg/edit?usp=drive_link

1. The promo code usage report downloaded from admin does not match what were seeing in Universal Report. 
Example: code FBOOK is showing 657 in admin report vs 682 in Universal (I got this number from adding usage in consumer and trade reports)

2. The promo code VPROM8 does not appear in the admin promo code usage report but IS appearing in the Universal Report (see files attached). It is also NOT a promo code set up in admin; I checked active, deleted, test and it was not one created. Can we track this back to a current/active promo code?

3. Promo code VPED3 - I received this query ""I’m just checking against the promo code report and the raw data and I think some of the VPED3 usage has been recorded as VPED12 instead? There’s registrations in April with VPED12 which wouldn’t have happened as this was an email code that was created for a much later eDM."" Could we please confirm as I am not able to locate this promo code in the Coupon Code column BV in Universal Report but can in column Q ""Order Url"" as coupon=VPED3 part of the URL but it doesn't appear in the actual Coupon Code column

Ticketing: Duplicate checks inconsistencies

Due Date:
Jun 20, 2025

Priority:
High - 7 days

Event Code:
2509 AusFitness

Description:
We have duplicate checks on Cart abandonment step and ticketing step (and also m.lup).  This does not seem to be behaving as expected.

If a product has ExcludeDuplicateChecks = TRUE that means:
    WORKING: When registering this product, don't check for duplicates
    NOT WORKING: When checking another purchase for duplicates, it should EXCLUDE any registrations with this ExcludeDuplicateChecksProduct flag from the set of data we are comparing to. 
        eg if CONTRACTOR has ExcludeDuplicateChecks = TRUE and john@example.com is registered as a contractor, 
        when I register a TRADE product ticket (ExcludeDuplicateChecks = FALSE) and
         if john@example.com registers, it should ALLOW that registration because the set we are comparing to will exclude john@example.com that is on a CONTRACTOR product
    Cart Abandonment step on first page
        If all products being purchased have ExcludeDuplicateChecks=TRUE then don't check for duplicates. eg If I'm getting 2 x Contractor passes and contractor has ExcludeDuplicateChecks=TRUE then no need to cehck for duplicates.
        If any of the products being purchased have ExcludeDuplicateChecks=FALSE then check for duplicates.  eg If I'm getting 2 x contractor passes and 1 x TRADE pass and Trade pass is ExcludeDuplicateChecks=False then we need to check for duplicates

When doing ADD PACK on an order on this screen: https://admin.lup.com.au/Ticket?EventID=2579

The client has noticed previous event packs have been copied across to this year's event and they show in the 'Add Pack' dropdown list (as a massive dropdown list).

To avoid confusion with this year's packs and for other team members 'Adding Packs' please grey out or ensure inactive/deleted packs should be hidden from this list? or can they be hard deleted? 

I've bulk updated the old packs to 2023 start and end date and started changing their Active status to Deleted status but they still show up. There's many packs to change manually to Deleted status. Can they be deleted in the backend?

Ticketing: Duplicate checks inconsistencies

Due Date:

Priority:

Event Code:
2509 AusFitness

Description:
We have duplicate checks on Cart abandonment step and ticketing step (and also m.lup).  This does not seem to be behaving as expected.

If a product has ExcludeDuplicateChecks = TRUE that means:
    WORKING: When registering this product, don't check for duplicates
    NOT WORKING: When checking another purchase for duplicates, it should EXCLUDE any registrations with this ExcludeDuplicateChecksProduct flag from the set of data we are comparing to. 
        eg if CONTRACTOR has ExcludeDuplicateChecks = TRUE and john@example.com is registered as a contractor, 
        when I register a TRADE product ticket (ExcludeDuplicateChecks = FALSE) and
         if john@example.com registers, it should ALLOW that registration because the set we are comparing to will exclude john@example.com that is on a CONTRACTOR product
    Cart Abandonment step on first page
        If all products being purchased have ExcludeDuplicateChecks=TRUE then don't check for duplicates. eg If I'm getting 2 x Contractor passes and contractor has ExcludeDuplicateChecks=TRUE then no need to cehck for duplicates.
        If any of the products being purchased have ExcludeDuplicateChecks=FALSE then check for duplicates.  eg If I'm getting 2 x contractor passes and 1 x TRADE pass and Trade pass is ExcludeDuplicateChecks=False then we need to check for duplicates

The above examples are assuming that duplicate checks are turned on the survey level.

        and John Smith had 5 different tickets (and 5 different visitor registrations).  
        All 5 of John Smith's registrations should have a value of 1 inserted in the question HotelMarketing into the answerdetails table.

As the event finished recently we need to check ticket sales and reports match Stripe transactions:
    for AMDA events they use their own stripe account
    We need to check that all the stripe transactions match the expodb records and hence the console reports
    Do all transactions exist in table and add up correctly
    Do the order totals match sum of packs in each order
    Do the total transactions and refunds on order match the packs in the order and total order
    Do any adjustments to payments are accounted for
Any queries please let me know.
Many thanks

Due Date:
May 6, 2025

Priority:
Normal

Description:
2505-Food & Hospitality Week

When we have ""Ticket-Duplicate Email"" set to ALL / FREE in ticketing, it validates that the email address does not already exist in the system when on the REGISTRATION STEP.

But it does not validate it on the CART ABANDONMENT email field on the first page.

Can we change the expected behaviour to validate on the first page / cart abandonment too please.

https://admin.lup.com.au/Survey/EditSurvey/53530
https://tickets.lup.com.au/food-and-hospitality-week-2025?cat=cat-fhw-registration

This behaviour can be the same for all events that have ticketing duplicate email turned on. (Of course factor in the ALL / FREE value of the field vs cart total)

It should also honour the new Exclude Duplicate check on TicketProducts

We've received the below incoming email from customer:
Hi there,
 
I have booked 4 tickets to the Décor & Design Show in Melbourne, and I am currently trying to book in Seminars on each ticket.
I have currently processed seminars for 2 of the 4 ticket holders, but the amount below is showing I have been charged $947.43, when it should read $647.44.
I did get errors twice, however I think the registration worked the second time on each.
 
Can you please check that these have been processed correctly and confirm the amount that has been charged to my card ending in ..9358?

In the transaction tab breakdown it does show extra charges after the first transaction and could only assume the page went down (as she mentioned above she did get errors twice) and she got charged again

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1210339001375514

Then if you check the Pack tab there seems to be duplicates of the seminars S3, S4, W2, S9, S10 for Elly and Kylie so something must have happened during registration.

We still printed the Position for the Trade Visitors only badge.

I've set-up a https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tcCe5D62Sbim0nM6VRVuTYElBGZZaqrnNC2PV5NV3zE/edit?gid=0#gid=0 of the pack & products that will answer this Business Type and Job Role and also listed the ones to exclude the Business Type & Job Role.

For other badge types such as Speaker or Media they still print on the bottom in VARTEXT 1.
For reference please see below card from last year: https://app.asana.com/1/423688738683911/project/1206414451066727/task/1207354805363822?focus=true

Attached badge samples from last event.

Any queries please let me know.
**Please note for VARTEXT 2 I will be setting up another card to print the MasterPass, Sessions and Workshop

We amended this around 6pm on Wednesday 4th June however the event had been live in operation since 2pm.

Onsite they were registering people via the iPads and the registration survey.

These registrants dropped into Admin as ""No Ticket"" and showed as ""Check Ticket Unregistered"" on the Entry Scanners. The team did press allow acces son the entry scanners to record attendance.

Action required
    May we please backfill this data so they have tickets and appear in console attendance reports?
    Can you also see which pack/product they belong to as the iPad survey filter would have been changed on the onsite ipad so these registrations belong to various packs/products.
    Otherwise use the default onsite pack/product

Post Event Reports will be expected within 72 hours, so this will need to be prioritised.

When using a pre-pop campaign eg with visitorID in url https://tickets.lup.com.au/pbc-brisbane-june-2025?cat=cat-registration&visitorID=8BD9A204-CBB7-4387-A569-E2C81A58981B

We want the cart abandonment fields to populate from the VISITOR table (not the TicketOrder table)

The context here is we are sms/emailing visitors telling them to register easily. So it follows that we want their details to show up on abandonment and registration steps.

Hi Team,
Need help please. SO SORRY for the due date, client is planning to go live end of week. Thank you!

For Auscryptocon's auto upgrade function, just before I create a Dev card, could you help me please check if the the setting I have is correct. I tried purchasing a Gen Ad ticket and a Super Yacht (Extras) but my ticket didn't auto upgrade to Premium Gen Ad ticket.

The client has also tried to register on their internal links on edge and chrome and also can't go past Step 2. For me and Jacq the InGo widget is loading fine. One expo registrant has sent the below screen-shot. Any idea what's causing this or if InGo has changed something?

We have Child Workshop Addons which we have currently linked to the Child Packs however the Registration Setting is set to NONE on these products and the Bypass feature https://admin.lup.com.au/EventParameter/Edit/12559 is not working anymore.


https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1210181770225998


Current logic is placed inside Registration page.
If product's registration setting set to None. It skips the Registration page therefore the pop up bypass not working.


https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1210181770225996


Prior to linking only to the Child Packs it showed the below Bypass pop-up on the Survey Questions page however this pop-up does not display anymore and goes next to the Addons page.

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1210181770226001

Addons page

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1210181770226003


Paula's feedback she didn't like how it displays next the Addons page if visitors only want to purchase entry tickets. She had preferred a faster registration.

RESULT/OUTCOME: Logic needs to be updated so that includes products set to NONE. That way this Bypass pop-ups again upon answering the survey questions.

When it comes in to Gmail it doesn't show the body.  And then when you do 'view entire message' it isn't responsive I think there must be some issue in html.

Description:
For ADD VIRTUAL SCANS button it currently adds on any answer record on any survey at the event and deviceid  NOT in (622,104)

Can we make it so that it does NOT add from SurveyDeviceMode=5 (ie don't include from scans in other ticket scanners). As we can add ticket scanners in easily anyway.

Also dont add from any survey that has title like zzz%

So it's just exhibitor scanners and registration on hardware that is put in the virtual scanner

When creating a new User, staff often get an error message that the mobile number already exists in the system.
It's not working when staff trying to find the mobile number using the search box on User page currently.

Expected result:
Staff can search the mobile number using the search box on the User page.
example if user entered ""408096344"" it would find mobile like %408096344%

Title of the task:
Overlapping Sessions Query

Due Date:
Apr 25, 2025

Priority:
Normal

Event Code:
2507 - Decor + Design & Green Design Show

Description:
This card initially is or discussion and scoping of what would be required to do this in ticketing.

It might be we decide there is a dowlnoad button in admin so we can see who is effected by it and customer service handle this.

On ticketing add-ons page we want to prevent people from selecting overlapping sessions as sometimes they are paying and this causes issues.

eg if 1 session is 12pm to 12:45pm and another is 12:30pm to 1pm, then it should not allow it to be selected.

Also make this change on the ticketing/addons/get log back in area.

Put this as on for all events. (Do we put an event parameter to allow this to be turned off? Or just leave it as on for now until it becomes an issue)?

Lilis says:

we can add a javascript validation on the ticketing page when user clicking the continue button for selected overlapping packs, the property of PackDateStart and PackDateFinish already on the page. estimate 2-4 hours works (not included deployments).


Jenny asks:

How do we manage overlapping sessions? 
Some session time-slots overlap. The client has already received refund request (for one session) due to the below sessions overlap. This maybe an occurring issue if the visitor doesn't take care in booking their sessions or notice the times and result in more refund requests.
S10: Activate the Power of AI in Design | 12PM – 12:45PM
W3: Designing a Timeless Business | 12PM – 1:30 PM
Can the page prompt if the 2 sessions are selected at the same time?

Exposervice restrict data by date

Due Date:
Apr 25, 2025

Priority:
Normal

Description:
In ExpoService we want to restrict the ability for TicketStream or PII to be sent to the webservice.  

Can we make it if the event finish date more than 1 year ago, then it will not send TicketStream data or  visitor data to devices, or better still just anonymise the email addresses and phone numbers that are sent. eg ""anonymised-guid@example.com"" and phone numbers all random 10 digit numbers

(double check where this happens and adjust accordingly)

We need to set up the API feeds for Indo Pacific Sydney
 
Required to set up:
    Exhibitor badge integration – as we have on all shows.
    Contractor badge integration – MIMO and All Access – same as we always have

Query from Steve:
Do we still need to have the actual badge purchase in a separate database, can it not drop directly into the existing DB as an unregistered ticket and once they assign it and the person registers it updates?

I have advised Steve re the above that we're not able to update as too complex.

Please find attached the API docs from Satish.
As noted from Jessie:
Confirming we won’t be using bump in/bump out badges for Indo Pacific, we will just use Exhibitor Badges, and edit to Exhibitor All Access package in Lup for any exhibitors requiring Build Phase Access.

Hi Neeshil, thank you for the set up details, I hope you can help with one more thing. 

We can see some purchases from Facebook Ads in GA4, but not seeing them in Facebook Ad Manager with the revenue, Do you have any documentation on setting up the Facebook Pixel to track purchases?  We are currently using GTM for the pixel, would it be better to install the pixel directly on the tickets page?

Reaching out about reporting. And how same day re-entries are not showing up on the attendance report. We have same day re-entries as displayed in the screen shot Fig 3 from admin (scan survey). However this figure is not showing on the attendance report seen in other screenshots Fig.1 and Fig. 2

We have checked back office and the report setting are correct.

Are we able to investigate this to see why the same entries are no displaying,

Event Code:
2510-SXSW Sydney

Description:
Per client's (Ari) email.

""I wanted to bring to your attention an issue related to purchase tracking on the LUP backend. Currently, we are unable to track purchases due to a missing data layer setup.

To resolve this, we need to implement the purchase event in the backend along with the appropriate data layer setup. Once this is completed, we can configure the purchase event properly in Google Tag Manager (GTM).

At the moment, when the user clicks the final purchase button, it is being triggered as a link event. This should ideally be identified as an eCommerce purchase event in order for tracking to work correctly.""

 something is happening with the report.
1. All my entry scanners have invalid items. I have the feeling that this is because the map that we give to visitors has a QR on it and staff is scanning it, however, could you have a look if there is something wrong with the onsite QR codes. Just in case the issue is on that.
2. I have also run the report and it says that from 4pm only 3 people came in but I had scanned like 11. My scanner is showing 11 tickets from 4pm, however in Console only 3 are showing.
3. See photos attached of the phones screens and ID's, QR Codes that we are using onsite, scan from my device (admin) and Console Report

Event Code:
2508 Moreton Bay Food Wine Festival

Description:
Events like moreton bay food wine festival have a lot of extras / ticket types. Their website has favouriting and will help people work out which extras they want to buy.

When they get to Lup's ticketing page they have to filter through and work it out again which isn't ideal.

The solution is that Moreton Bay website, when calling our ticketing link, will pass a collection of pack IDs (extras) in the URL (TicketPackAPICodes) and then we should:
    Highlight those favourited packs
    and/or highlight the category headings of those favourited packs (in case the accordion is closed)

The mockups are just examples and looking at easy ways to highlight the packs / categories.

Favourites in the URL
For simplicity our ticketing site can take a URL:
https://tickets.lup.com.au/moreton-bay-festival-2025?cat=cat-registration&favourites=packID1,packID2,packID3,packID4

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R4OnQFrtdsAmuhhEsCGZhR6nQ6XmDwjHt4sh-V-PRvM/edit?slide=id.g3306e5ec599_0_136#slide=id.g3306e5ec599_0_136

Slides show mockup of highlighting favourited packs and categories

International Exhibitors:
So they can separate on their website the different Pavilions which is where the international exhibitors will be, the client asked if it can be advised in their website profile but that would require us to custom map this right? So can't be done?

Normally there is an import of their exhibitors like last year however just need to distinguish whether they are an international exhibitor or a local exhibitor for this event. Or is there another way? I've already advised this form https://admin.lup.com.au/EventExhibitor/Index/d9eacb74-f013-422b-aef8-a75f57e3ed22?sId=53353 is hardcoded.

The client is looking to send out their OEM live this Wednesday morning and wanted to finalise this by tomorrow morning based on our replies.

Thanks
Sorry I'm not 100% sure how this all works and Mich that had set-up the OEM last year is not in.",Dev BAU Sprint,,,,DEV-3228,

We are having issues with Exhibitor's onsite when the number of leads they have scanned shows a higher number in their console dashboard compared to their csv file when they download their data.

I understand the dashboard number is higher because of unregistered tickets, or maybe duplicate scans. But Exhibitors don't know this and always think they have lost leads.

Can we have something that indicates this better to Exhibitors?
I like the fact that the dashboard shows total scans but it should mention ""unregistered scans"" or ""duplicate scans""
I am hesitant to not show all scans at all because will say ""it feels like i scanned 100 but my csv only shows 50"" So at least it would be good to note 50 unregistered scans, 50 registered scans etc.

Neeshil note: This should only show registered unique scans and the numbers should match what is in the download CSV file","General Dev Tasks,Dev BAU Sprint",,,,DEV-3181,

* CURRENCY is already on pack level
* Use of the multi-store configuration is a suggestion not a requirement
* Use of same or different stripe account - let me know if that is needed at all. ie if it's easier to just use same stripe account.

This card is about working out if it can be done and what would be needed.

Apr 11, 2025

Priority:

Description:
Exhibitor shop has a payment button that says pay by invoice. We want this to only be 'on request'

So a solution is make that only appear if we send a special parameter in URL

https://shop.lup.events/exhibitor/food-and-hospitality-week-2025

eg URL could have ?pbi=1  
eg PayByInvoice=1

Or is it something more unique to each event ?pbi=ad32kzz

But how do we know what that 'ad32kzz' random string is for each event?

Hi Team, 

Kindly assist on updating API codes on all questions that are missing the API Code Values.

Event organiser has been given these 4 files attached.

They will return them with API CODE columns updated and we need to bulk import them back to our system.

update QuestionAPICode and SvcQuestionTitle

For Options update QuestionOptionAPICode and OptionCode

(double check for yourself if that is correct, but that's my understanding)

If the value is now BLANK then update to blank, don't ignore a blank value.

(Dev you can prepare scripts to make this happen please)

We will let you know once we have final files

Please refer to this sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BeI3UOTeSZh2MFVuhkqvEHusIRjgfdEewkf_ZFRsoIU/edit?gid=1863547099#gid=1863547099 (please note this spreadsheet is for RT that was cloned to Imarc) and look for column H and column M

e.g this question has the API code mapped
https://admin.lup.com.au/QuestionDetail/EditQuestionDetail/179567

but this one doesn't, it's empty
https://admin.lup.com.au/QuestionDetail/EditQuestionDetail/181664

We use Pass2U to generate Apple Wallet / Google Wallet passes.

Chris says ""instead i would pull ticketing and have a look at PassService and where its called and check how many times methods are called""

My previous undertsanding was 1 pass created for 1 ticket = 1 credit. 

Pass2U seems to be using a lot of credits

100,000 passes created in the last month. This doesn't seem correct?

Please check and verify if this is correct or if error on our end?

Our register reminder emails that automatically get sent, will send individual emails out to ask for registering those tickets that are unregistered.

However for the Gala Dinner some sponsors will buy 3 tables of 10 for the gala that means I have 30 unregistered tickets, I will receive 30 emails asking me to forward to my guest getting them to register the tickets. (Which isn't very good or friendly especially for a sponsor who has just paid $12,000 for tickets)

lso in these cases it's probably the admin person who will register all 30 themselves rather than forwarding the links so having 30 emails is a bad experience

    Currently the system will send individual emails up to 15 tickets.
    Can we adjust this so for 15 or above it would send just 1 email with 15 links in it.
    (and change 15 to be a more reasonable number like 8)
    Maybe we have ability to change the cutoff number on event basis but default to 8.
    Individual emails if less than 5 unregistetered
    1 email with all links if it is more than 5 unregistered tickets
    And is it based off 'unregistered' tickets or is it based off total number of tickets they have? (I don't mind)

Currently for events that sell tickets onsite with Lup onsite tickets (printed QR CODES):
     the online sales reports only show the online numbers, and 
    onsite quantities and $ have to be seen in the Square reports.  
    So the organiser needs to see two reports. 
    (But also some of the onsite tickets are in the online report if they get registered.). This is not ideal

So we want a systematic way, at end of each day, to upload the data in to expodb so it appears on online sales reports and also univeral download
 
    Square ITEM SALES report will have the ticket barcode attached to each line
    Square tickets are also scanned on a dedicated lead scanner ""Square sales""
    If a user registers on an iPad they are getting their ticket order created automatically ($0 , default pack)
    So knowing this we want to tidy it up, so that at end of each day, the 'Square onsite packs/products' match the square sales dashboard'

    1: Square sales using ITEM export from Square:
        UPDATE EXISTING: If the barcode Exists in tickets table already and has a PackID = 58023 (Onsite Registered)
            update: pack/product, price, transaction, order amount, so that it matches the square report
        or CREATE NEW: If it doesn't exist, then add to expodb as a ticket/ticketorder etc with pack/product, price, transaction + order value set so it matches the square report
        IF THERE IS NO BARCODE ??? on the item in Square Export - add it with a random new barcode that starts with 3xxxxxx
    2: Square sales lead  scanner
        https://admin.lup.com.au/Survey/EditSurvey/54409
        If a barcode is scanned on this (7 digits only) and does Not exist in tickets table, add it as generic  pack/product (eg Square - Other  PackID 59811) with $0 price allocated. (Create the $0 transaction too)
    3: For any other Onsite tickets scanned but not already in tickets table from the 1 and 2 above
        SCANNED means: Select distinct answer.barcode from Answer where surveyID in (Select surveyID from survey where eventID=2526) and answer.deviceID not in (622,104)
            And Barcode not exists in Tickets.shortcode where eventID=2526 and TicketStatus='Active'
        Add as generic pack/product ONSITE UNREGISTERED (PackID 59838) $0 
        Filter it for scans that are 7 digits only and all numeric. Ignore other scans

My expected behaviour is that in the universal report because those scans are before the event, then they should be in Before Event Scans column, not after event scans column

My expected behaviour is that in the attendance report they show up as attended on those days.

This could be due to sql stress from avalon? do you think its worth wrapping both this into keyed semiphore eg 1 import transcation per event at 1 time? @lilis.ramadhani  @anaru.herbert. https://github.com/Lup-Events/Lup.ImporterService/blob/29f9efd04491f5bac821b44f723[…]/src/Lup.ImporterService.Web/Services/V2/TicketUpsertService.cs (https://github.com/Lup-Events/Lup.ImporterService/blob/29f9efd04491f5bac821b44f72352dd4906b4181/src/Lup.ImporterService.Web/Services/V2/TicketUpsertService.cs#L92-L104)

This thing is still not working properly. I have just logged in again and I have just approved 6 people. But if I filter by status ""Approved"", it says there is no data to show as you can see below. What has changed from last time is that the number of people I approved has gone up from 0 to 6. However, the real number of approved people is 60! But you can only see this if you count the people that are showing as approved. I don't know if the people I have approved have been informed that they have been approved. I would very much like to know. And I'd very much like the below counter showing the number of approved and rejected people accurately.  Can you please reach out to the company? Many thanks!

It looks like this now (see screenshot attached), because my colleague had to re-do everything manually and approve them manually again.  The filtering system is also not working for us.

Overview
    Currently those who register in RX Mercury can not purchase add-ons
    Currently RX Mercury needs a way, at certain shows, for visitors to request/apply to attend ‘vendor approved sessions’

Solution:
    Provides a way for registrants in RX Mercury to seamlessly select sessions to attend, using Lüp’s system
    It allows for exhibitors to log in and approve or reject registrants in to their sessions 
    This same system will also allow for paid or free add-ons (that do not require approval) to be sold at other RX Mercury events, with minimal additional work

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IMMyKKmCg-xgO5gtE4kn5MAE66oV_EAbFX4gVJ4imEU/edit#slide=id.g276c8383cf6_1_11

    Mercury registrant clicks a link and takes to addons page in ticketing with URL and QRCODE pre-populated https://tickets.lup.com.au/AddOn/Get/2421?email=xxxxxx&qr=11111
        If email and QR is provided in URL it should auto-submit this page
    API integration to receive data from RX:
        Update every 5 mins automatically and/or
        When a registrant uses the AddOn/get link it should fetch directly from RX on demand
    Addon selection
        Existing add-ons should be fine
        Need the ability to come back in later and de-select an add-on (no refunds needed at this time)
    Add-ons with 'verification'  NEW status 
        Some add-ons we may set with the product field of 'requires approval'
        This means the status on the addon will be 'verification'  NEW (or similar)
        So that means it's not a confirmed addon, but awaiting approval or rejection by the vendor (exhibitor)
    Confirmation Emails:
        Visitor confirmation email after add-on 'purchase'
            It should show summary of addons and their status. eg ""Pending"" approval or ""Approved"" ""waitlisted"",  rejected. (Need to confirm with organiser if we want visitor to see that they are waitlisted or not)
            Confirmation email sent after exhibitor updates the status of an addon (application)
    Vendor (Exhibitor) link to products
        Client (ie vendors/exhibitors) will need to be linked to an add-on product so that when they log in they can see the visitors requesting approval and actually approve them
    Vendor console amendments

API Details
 
The api works in such a way that it is paginated using token-based pagination. This means for the first call you will not supply token value, if there are more results then returned in the first call, our api will provide a token in the response which can then be supplied in the next call.  Then you keep calling until the response no longer returns a token.
The only required parameter is the eventEditionGbsCode. But there is an optional modifiedDate, if no modifiedDate is supplied all badges for the event edition will be returned.
If a modifiedDate is supplied then only badges modified since that date will be returned.
 
This allows for them to retrieve incremental updates after an initial data pull.

The organiser has reported the OEM Manual is still “glitching”. 
Verbatim: When using the unique url to our exhibitor manual the page seems to not load fully, not allow us to scroll and then gets “stuck”.

It won’t let me scroll at random moments and then gets “stuck”. I have attached a screen recording.
 
When I am trying to scroll using my mouse it doesn't work.

    And also enable it so that any new registrations that are approved from that point in time, automatically receive the confirmation email and SMS

All the remaining approved categories can go on Monday 24th
    Dev to process send of batches

After invitations were registered they got a confirmation email only with no PDF
Digital passes were apple wallet and google wallet only
PDF was not used because of worry about people photoshopping
PDF's are turned OFF on ticket confirmation and Digital Pass landing page
Passes go out via email and SMS
From when we bulk sent the passes out, we then turned it on so that all registrations that got confirmed would instantly get their email and SMS confirmation with passes

Last year there was a delay in the visitors receiving and SMS is higher priority to receive first and then emails as noted here:
Dev note:
the SMS sending process takes more time than email. Wait until all the mqueue records has been dumped to Linqpad result, means all records have been added to MQueue table, otherwise keep waiting.

Please do all possible to not delay for send this year. Any queries please let me know.

The client has requested if we can add a button or feature that allows the registrant to skip or Bypass the Addons Seminars page and goes straight to the Confirmation page. If they are purely only attending the expo and not the Seminars they want the Expo registrant to have quicker registration otherwise they are scrolling down to hit continue or even Abandoned Cart thinking they have to pay.

They found alot of visitors had Abandoned cart from last year's event.

For example on this Reminder section: https://admin.lup.com.au/Ticket/SendReminder?id=2417

Are we able to add another section underneath the Main Products to send to Addons like the Gala Dinner Addon.

What do you think of this pattern:

1. User initiates a new import and selects a blueprint (v2).
2. User provides a file, which we upload to S3.
3. API returns a pre-signed URL, batchId, and a JSON schema (compatible with libraries like Ajv) with _comment to say if this prop is a product or answer detail to help structure the responses.
4. We use papaparse streaming to process each row:
- Validate with Ajv.
- If valid, transform the dynamic object to a typed payload and call an upsert endpoint and dispatch a message.
- If invalid, call a log endpoint with the error and row reference.
5. Dispatch all messages, perform necessary actions, and listen for responses to track batch outcomes.
6. Provide endpoint to say result of batch, e.g. pre-signed URL to download the original file, summary of 200 rows processed, 150 imported and the 50 errored and line numbers, (if they want to be able to download a file with errors col on the right lines then Denzel can just pull and update the file in the browser) 

Let me know your thoughts on this approach.

Thanks,
Chris

Need assistance please. Thank you!
I have updated the ticket setup based on the client’s latest request. Initially, the https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketProduct/EditTicketProduct/37051 ticket type was only available via accreditation, but the client has requested to make it available on the https://tickets.lup.co.nz/foodstuffs-expo-2025?cat=cat-registration page.
Here’s what has been done:
 • A new pack and product were initially created to differentiate reporting.
 • However, the client has now confirmed they want this ticket type to match exactly as the original accreditation ticket and not be separated in reports, however there were 100 visitors who has registered
 • The newly created https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketPack/Edit/58486has been made inactive, and the existing pack is now used on the main registration page, linked to the same product as accreditation.
Action Required:
Please move/transfer all sold tickets from https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketProduct/EditTicketProduct/39045  to https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketProduct/EditTicketProduct/37051 to align with the updated setup.

Hello,

We are contacting you as we have identified that your AWS Account currently has one or more AWS Lambda functions using the .NET 6 runtime.

We are ending support for .NET 6 in Lambda on December 20, 2024. This follows .NET 6 End-Of-Life (EOL) which will be on November 12, 2024 [1].

As described in the Lambda runtime support policy [2], end of support for language runtimes in Lambda happens in several stages. Starting on December 20, 2024, Lambda will no longer apply security patches and other updates to the .NET 6 runtime used by Lambda functions, and functions using .NET 6 will no longer be eligible for technical support. Additionally, the .NET 6 runtime will no longer be available in the Console, although you can still create and update functions using the .NET 6 runtime through AWS CloudFormation, AWS CLI, AWS SAM, or other tools. Starting February 28, 2025, you will no longer be able to create new Lambda functions using the .NET 6 runtime. Starting March 31, 2025, you will no longer be able to update existing functions using the .NET 6 runtime.

We recommend that you upgrade your existing .NET 6 functions to the latest available .NET runtime in Lambda before December 20, 2024.

End of support does not impact function execution. Your functions will continue to run. However, they will be running on an unsupported runtime which is no longer maintained or patched by the AWS Lambda team.

This notification is generated for functions using the .NET 6 runtime for the $LATEST function version. The following command shows how to use the AWS CLI [3] to list all functions in a specific region using .NET 6, including published function versions. To find all such functions in your account, repeat this command for each region:

aws lambda list-functions --region AP-SOUTHEAST-2 --output text --query ""Functions[?Runtime=='dotnet6'].FunctionArn""

A list of your affected Lambda functions is available in the 'Affected resources' tab of your AWS Health Dashboard.

From 180 days before the deprecation date, you can also use Trusted Advisor to identify all functions using the .NET 6 runtime, including published function versions [4].

If you have any concerns or require further assistance, please contact AWS Support [5].

On this event we have the mulitpage addons enabled. Usually when we have addons, there is a little pop up on the ticketing site that says ""Be sure to book any add-ons before proceeding. (This is optional). Click BACK to select your add-ons, otherwise PROCEED to the next step.""

Hey team- good morning. Could someone please check the EELondon ticketing page? They received feedback on January 9th regarding an issue where the page hangs with a ""PLEASE WAIT"" message. I conducted some tests this morning, and everything appears to be working fine on my end. However, I also noticed a number of pending transactions from the 9th.

I would like to seek help regarding this matter on Avalon.

Steve is asking to process a refund for the $98 however, it doesn't proceed. What I am thinking, it is because there is no amount showing on the order. (please see screenshot below)

When you look at the pack of this order, you will see $98 charge for ""Defence Day Ticket - Friday 28 March"" (please see screenshot below). That is the amount that the event organiser is asking to refund to the visitor.

Client has agreed to setup new Product and Pack for additional staff passes.

Currently we have not set a closure date to this form and due date is set on 3rd February, the client is asking if it's possible, to extract the current list of exhibitor passes? Once imported into the admin system, can the remaining unsent passes be sent out?
Also, it would be good if we could extract the new attendee list every Monday and send out the passes on a weekly basis, as exhibitors are requesting their tickets as they register.

Though I will recommend to streamline the workflow and setting up a closure date to the form to have a finalized list of additional exhibitors, and so you only need to perform a single import and we can send out the reminders along with their tickets in one batch.

This can be due to:
    Manual changes to orders. eg partial refunds, refunds, and tickets kept active
    Test transactions being made to ACTIVE
    Transactions going through but not being recorded in our system
    or other inconsistencies

Having the wrong data in ExpoDB means our data is wrong in reporting and in new console, and transformation data set.

We want to perform checks on each TicketOrder, as well as the event as a whole.

As a second step, we want to download the Stripe transactions and compare them with the transactions we have in the DB. (eg today I did that with IODS and realised that one person was charged twice, even though ExpoDB had it marked as 1 transactions PENDING and 1 SUCCESS)

On each TicketOrder:
    does the TicketOrderTotalAmount match the Sum of TicketOrderTransactions
    does the sum of TicketOrderPacks match the TotalTicketOrderAmount - TicketOrderCardFees-TicketOrderAdminFees
    Is the ticket active but the main ticketorderpack inactive?
    Is the ticket active but the main ticketorderproduct inactive
    Order ACTIVE, Ticket ACTIVE, Transactions are not COMPLETE 
    Is there a Test Transaction, but the order is Active not Test


For a total event's orders:
    Does the sum of TicketOrderCardFees + TicketOrderAdminFees match the (Sum Of TicketOrderTransactions - Sum of TicketOrderPacks)

Are there TicketOrders that been Cancelled but have Active TicketOrderPacks?

Are there TicketOrders that are ACTIVE but have Transactions that are TEST?

Output:
    Should this be a query run manually by dev team? Or is it something that we can download from Admin (that shows up for all events that have an end date later than today-3 months?
    We would need EventID, EventCode, TicketOrderID, Admin link to the TicketOrder, TicketORderName, TicketOrderTotalAmount, SumOfTikcetOrderPacks, SumOfTicketOrderTransactions, Reason it is in this list. Sort it by EventDateFinish

It looks like when we add / delete a product on the survey or we edit a product’s entitlements, an exponential amount of tickets are being added to the ticketstream?

If we edit a product, then shouldn’t a distinct set of TicketID’s that are connected to that product be added to the stream instead?

Can we fix this please

Related to task: https://app.asana.com/0/1207272063708790/1208932376326011/f


The client has asked how the registration page will look like if the capacity is reached (sold out).
This only applies to Product: https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketProduct/EditTicketProduct/38744, we will need to set a capacity of 350 as client requires. 
To test this, I have put a capacity of 1 and tried to send myself an invite. There is already 1 active ticket and so this Product is now sold out.
Upon clicking the link, I got to registration page (please see below screenshot), it still says my coupon is valid, and not until I enter my details in, it won't show that the ticket/product is sold out.

Is there a way we can have a text to displays that the ticket is sold out right after I landed on the page.

the client is now asking to separate the ticketing pages or creating new event to separate the Partnership Awards (done through accreditation), reason is because
they want to personalise the invitation email subject lines, event overview title, event overview context, artworks (ticketing header and background), invitation email copies, etc.
Currently, we have the below 2 Products using Invitation:

Steve has requested if we can add a new answer option to existing records that haven't answered the survey question. This would be beneficial to other clients and saves Dev to back-fill answers for other events that require this.

Organiser Portal
https://admin.lup.com.au/Organiser/Accreditation/Index/ac6dda73-4884-4f67-bce0-9be5f7e6ef50
As an example below currently the visitor's record only has existing answers to Edit. Are we able to have another button next to 'Add Answer' ?

The question that will be frequently manually added in the next avalon event is https://admin.lup.com.au/QuestionDetail/EditQuestionDetail/177422

In this page https://admin.lup.com.au/Organiser/Visitor/EditAnswer/44359197
Modify The 'Add Answer' popup window/ a new page to have below:

Question              : [Question ComboBox] - already exist
QuestionOption        : [Option Checkbox] (if any)                        
                        if the question type is a Radiobutton/radio popup, if an option                                                  
                        selected -> make other checkboxes disabled
Answer                : (readonly if QuestionOption exists, and automatically filled                                     
                        the value if QuestionOption selected)

If The Question is a Checkbox question, and if more than 1 option selected, then create the AnswerDetails rows as many as selected options.

So the organiser or the CS member can add a new answer option.

Morning Mono!
As Febri is off may you please assist with a recent import for Mines and Money. Unfortunately it can't wait until Febri is back. I was going to slack him when he was online. So an investor list was uploaded yesterday and I did some spot checks and noticed the visitors with United States was imported with Canada. I had a closer look this morning and noticed the ID's were back to front. This is now corrected on the import template however the data is not correct - mainly the country data. Are you able to please re-import or are we able to fix the Country data without re-importing? https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f-Md2Ire6Ryvuqs2S7ldtZojhYUTLHZ1JWgabAQudEQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0
The client is off today and will be back in tomorrow. She may extract this data and then import into Hubspot (for this event they are not using our OAPI).

The event uses TicketMaster barcodes (short and longcodes) - RAS would like to break down the Ticketmaster barcodes by individual ticket type for Accreditation. Sharyn the organiser has agreed to the set-up costs for split barcodes by ticket type. She has sent through the attached 2024 barcodes files for each ticket type.

These need to be implemented for all registrations at the event

This was done for 2024 and worked well. This needs to be done before we start sending badges, but ideally do all this before we go-live ie someone registers, then our system will update the default LUP barcode to a ticketmaster barcode.

So we want to:
     bulk update in our system those who have used the promo codes, from their existing pack/products to the 'unpaid' version of their packs and products.
    And also update the promo codes to point to the unpaid versions of the packs instead.

And then do the Vice-Versa once they have paid

Event starts 23rd November, but we need time to test the integration properly.

Hey Team,
The organiser is using Eventsair for registration / ticketing, before and during the event.

We need the ability for our lup app to scan and print badges from Events air.

They will be using Events Air pre and during the event. Anyone turning up onsite and wants to buy a ticket will buy through events air. 

Their data then api's to lup, allowing them to scan and print a badge.

Additionally we need to pull across all registration data of each visitor. This is due to exhibitors will be using lup hardware/app to scan exhibitor leads.

Note it would be good if we can re-use this integration with other events in the future too

Hi Lawrence,

I've had a chat with the team here internally and as the API is an Open API, the documentation available for using the API is the https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__developer.eventsair.com_docs_&d=DwMFaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=jwSU_QrB71utaR27ChZtweUx9srKxVfDMjzrW6GB4C0&m=0Fsrk5f2vsPuBmZoFZtCUsFPOwqfi8wU-j1X1Xknibe_wX_8AcupWfJ6H5QumgnT&s=BmYMmiP4jFrXMIDMme3okGLgDkGOMyCNIVcqhwryH6M&e= link that I sent through on our call. I have been advised that this is detailed and gives a developer all details required to get started including how to issue querys and using apollo sandbox to get up to speed quickly. 

To get access to the API, Crypto will need to first complete the form linked here (I checked and saw that they have not signed up before): https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.eventsair.com_event-2Dmanagement-2Dsoftware_event-2Dintegrations_open-2Dapi-2Dsign-2Dup&d=DwMFaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=jwSU_QrB71utaR27ChZtweUx9srKxVfDMjzrW6GB4C0&m=0Fsrk5f2vsPuBmZoFZtCUsFPOwqfi8wU-j1X1Xknibe_wX_8AcupWfJ6H5QumgnT&s=rTMtC4m3oN8Q2qiuOzueGoyz_iNaaaNS_PPOQo2ZOCs&e=

Once this is done, the support team will be in touch with further details to ensure that the API feature is enabled and setup correctly.

I have also had a chat with the team on how immediately the data is available in the API and they have advised that the developer would need to write in when tey want to pull the data, this could be hourly or daily, etc. If you have a look at the API documentation, it advised that there are usage limits on the API so you would just need to make sure that it doesn't exceed the limits set.

Lastly, I have been advised that the QR code data within EventsAir consists of a combination of two fields: ID and GUID and looks like this: ID,GUID  Both are generated by EventsAir that is available within the Open API.

Hi Neeshil,

I'd recommend running the query on it's own for just one contact record, then check the response headers to see the cost of the query. I ran a similar query in my own even and found the cost was around 400, but this may differ depending on exactly what fields you need. Since there's an hourly limit of 1,000,000,  that query should be able to handle 2500 registrations in an hour, though there is also a limit of 750 HTTP requests per 5 minutes. The best practice for keeping the data up to date, would be to use webhooks so that the query can be run automatically when an attendee registers. In terms of how quickly the API updates, the data is available to query as soon as it is entered into the database, which typically is at most a few seconds after a site submission .

The specific fields will depend what you mean exactly by 'status of the registrant', 'answers to their registration question' and 'product types of the registrant', I would recommend checking our schema reference to see if the exact fields are available https://developer.eventsair.com/docs/reference.

Starting November 20, 2024, statement descriptors for card payments made via the PaymentIntents and Checkout Sessions APIs will be required to include the statement descriptor prefix that you’ve set in your https://59.email.stripe.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fdashboard.stripe.com%2Fb%2Facct_1MZnE5AOvJgbU0md%3Fdestination=https%253A%252F%252Fdashboard.stripe.com%252Fsettings%252Fupdate%252Fpublic%252Fsupport-details/1/01010192f878a66a-b664b57e-eab6-4bdd-8467-22cf82de55d9-000000/VAfo0Z6mrMx7pi9QLIg4HmC6jU5ZxVLY1d7mNyLoVsc=377. This prefix must clearly indicate your business name or DBA.
 

 
What this means for you
 

 
To accommodate this change, we’ve added the statement_descriptor_suffix parameter. After November 20, 2024, you’ll need to use statement_descriptor_suffix on card payments to define any characters that you’d like to appear alongside the prefix to form your dynamic statement descriptor.
 

 
Our records show you have set a dynamic Statement Descriptor on PaymentIntents in the past, however, no API requests have been made in the past 365 days to create a payment.
 

 
It will not be possible to add a dynamic statement descriptor to a card payment using the statement_descriptor parameter. As an alternative, you can omit the parameter entirely so that only the static prefix will be used.
 
 

 
 
Note that this change will only affect card payments made via the PaymentIntents and Checkout Sessions APIs when using a dynamic statement descriptor. If your integration does not set the statement_descriptor parameter at the time of payment, there’s no action required of you.
 

 
See our docs for more guidance on https://59.email.stripe.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fdocs.stripe.com%2Fget-started%2Faccount%2Fstatement-descriptors%23set-the-statement-descriptor-on-non-card-charges/1/01010192f878a66a-b664b57e-eab6-4bdd-8467-22cf82de55d9-000000/g_T1QMJbCih8B87njIsXR4kS01jT75vwU76nBdEvsnQ=377.

Although badges will be printed onsite when visitors check in, clients have some store changes happening so questions are being asked for what store they registered under and  would be good to have this on the PDF for reference and if we re-send pdf tickets before the event.

A button like these in the https://console.lup.events/partnerticketing/739806b8-9253-4bf4-8a9a-8562828f55f3/01926450-1edc-4a17-a89e-70929812af69/guests page

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1208695162081827


To build the request you need to ask for the guest summary details and versionid

the details can be prepared like in this page

the revoke tickets request will be like this:
{
    ""versionId"": ""{{versionId}}"",
    ""guests"": [
        {
            ""guestId"": ""guid"",
            ""tickets"": [

As a Partner
I want the ability to uninvite a guest
So that I can control my invite list

    Partial cancellations on a single order are required
    Uninvite would cancel the ticket
    Does a new one get generated in its place for the partner and go back in to their pile of unsent
    How does this interact with ticket identifier batches system
    Notification: If partial cancellation, then re-send the tickets.  ""An email will be sent to xxxxxx with all the remaining tickets.""
    If cancelling all tickets don't send anything

We did a once off or twice off for IMARC.  

Can we automate this?  Not just for this one event, but for the Gala Dinner feature. 

If this ends up being done by a EventParameter, then on the DOWNLOAD tab it would be good to show:
    Answers from registration for these questions are automatically included in the report: xxxx, yyy, zzzz;  or
    There are no answers from registration included automatically in this report.  Only add-on dietary requirements will be included. Contact your account manager to confirm.

We currently are not integrating against stock controller, we need to deduct QTY Available when an orgainser allocates tickets to partner. Pretty sure this is currently done in stock by a stored proc.

Step 2 Once transaction has been completed call the proc to adjust stock
Step 3 Test and confirm in admin on local that it works as expected

There is no shared state as of now, operation lock will work only with 1 instance running.

Client feedback: To work on
Failed Assessments - from Ridin Hearts event alot of staff had failed their Assessment - how can RAS staff view what answers they got incorrect or where can they download these answers?
Invitation Import Template: can the template also include a column of their pass type so they can import one big list? Instead of individual lists Some events have up to 15 pass types.
They also go through an Agency and sometimes the staff are all mixed up so quite involved trying to separate them to different pass types.

Any guidance please on this work or what's required for future development so I can report back to client?


RnB feedback

Event: https://admin.lup.com.au/Event/EventDetail/2339
Their staff Agency Troys has also provided feedback:

1a.
    When someone chooses incorrect question, they should realistically be told they have failed and asked to re-start again, would make it easier and quicker for staff. (We can work around this in the meantime though).
I know I have already mentioned this from their first event so following up.

If you have managed to pass the test, you then require completing your details on registration. A few issues:

Neeshil says:
    Do we let them go to the end and then tell them which questions were wrong? No, stop them on current question.
    Do we tell them on current question that this is wrong and then take them back to the start? No, just notify them that this question is wrong and they need to select another.
    Or something else?

1b.
When they do questionnaire and get to registration.. but can't complete rego.. they have to then come back and start again. Can we get it to remember that they finished the questionnaire? FUTURE TASK
 
2. DONE BY CS TEAM
    Upload RSA physical ID or Screen shot of your digital ID. If staff members have interim certificate, it doesn’t allow them to upload interim certificates, only RSA Cards.

Based on this feedback can we add another upload field to capture their interim certificate?

Neeshil says new question of: 
    Do you have your RSA or an Interim Ceritificate?
        RSA
        Interim Certificate
        I have already uploaded this in the last 30 days with Sydney Showgrounds, and RSA supplied is still valid.
If RSA then show existing upload question for RSA ID
If Interim Certificate just show a different upload question for uploading that instead. (Check with Dev if we can disable face recognition on that certificate question)


2b. 
DONE: Can this event's current registration, link to their previous registration? (ie list the events and links)

 ON HOLD Can we auto-approve firstname + lastname + email based on a previously linked event.
    Auto-approve? can we have a list?

3. Chris test please:
    If you upload an RSA card that is from a screenshot from Service NSW (Ivonne’s RSA attached as an example) it isn’t accepting it, it states “please try a different photo, this photo was too blurry”
Attached is the staff card. Any instructions for this?

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1206014727397637

4. 
    There are also many limitations about what to upload in terms of JPG, or JNP, no PDF’s, etc… Which makes it really hard for staff to upload the correct format.
Not sure if we can do anything about this point. Seems fine for other staff who are able to upload their ID.

Neeshil note: We need to understand which files are getting blocked. Also perhaps we better articulate the formats available on the question itself.  Check what formats Android and Iphone generally upload now. eg HEIFF HEIC etc etc

Chris please confirm what files upload. And what standard images android and iphone try and upload. eg if they are uploading HEIFF and it doesn't allow us to then we should get this fixed if posssible

5. Is there a way for organiser to see first hand their Expiry date (which is one of the required survey question to answer) https://admin.lup.com.au/QuestionDetail/EditQuestionDetail/158533 (from Dreamstate event) rather than checking each one under Edit. Especially for events with lots of staff they want to quickly Approve them and also helps onsite at the event when everyone is so busy and staff all coming onsite all at once (no time to check all this info). Can it display underneath email address field?

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1206015144000061


They did emphasis this feature will greatly help them due they had one staff got Approved but his RSA was expired and they mention the police were checking or something like that.

Neeshil note: This one is currently a bit hard to implement

6. Automated Reminders - can these emails be Automated? Also a timing thing as it's very manual task from their end as they already have quite a bit to do their end to get staff ready and inducted prior to the event (currently I'm assisting them with sending the reminders)

Neeshil note: This one is currently a bit hard to implement


7. Coupon link usage. A few staff struggling to go through induction whereby they start but if they stop or didn't pass, then try to go through again on link it advises 'error message - like stock oversold something like that' which the User doesn't understand the meaning of this. Can the coupon reset or at what point they can go back to use this coupon. Again it will be hard when staff some onsite at the event when it's so busy and hard to advise staff what the issue is.

Neeshil note: Is this still happening,it should be fine now.


8. Restricted Admin Access - Organiser is looking at allowing their staff agencies to access Organiser portal but only to their Staff (so they can manage their staff a bit more) not to rest of the database - can this be done?

TO DISCUSS: Neeshil says: Not currently, but also we need a better understanding of this. Can we understand this a bit better.
    Can the report filter by Company (https://admin.lup.com.au/Organiser/Invite/InviteReport/cdab3710-1433-4f53-80cb-1388a4cc0e03) have a dropdown or text filter?

CHRIS PLEASE:
9. For the Assessment Test the organiser is looking at adding multiple choice Q&A - what's involved in setting this up? Would the current script allow Yes and No answers plus multiple choice questions?

Neeshil says: Yes we should be able to.  

Can we mix up the options and the order of them? Not for now


10. When a staff registers for a current event and have already registered previously... - please elaborate....
Auto-approval

Target end of August

So i cancelled the additional Gala Dinner Ticket.

Now the badge prints as GALA GALA 53.

Please pre-prepare the query so this can be actioned promptly

     bulk update in our system those who have used the promo codes, from their existing pack/products to the 'unpaid' version of their packs and products.
    And also update the promo codes to point to the unpaid versions of the packs instead.

And then do the Vice-Versa once they have paid

Summary:
    If the promo code in that list was used on an order
        For Tickets, TicketOrder tables etc:
            So PackID 52751 changes to 57125
            ProductID 35334 changes to 38067
    Also update Coupon if promo code is in that list:
        Also the coupon.PackID will update if the promo code is in that list.

We want this to be able to work with Smart QR Codes too.  Currently if we use SmartQR Code to replace ticket then it messes up when it gets to server as then we have two tickets with same longcode.

I would imagine that on the server side, when using replace ticket, if it's a smart QR Code is the 'replacement' ticket, then the server side actions should be different. ie cancel the existing SmartQRCode 'order' and 'ticket'. Update the ticketlongcode on that record (maybe prefix it with REPLACED_)

And then finish the replace ticket function


For Wristband Packs & Products we will be using the REPLACE TICKET function in the Lüp App with SMART QR Codes.

SMART QR Codes Exported in this Asana Card: https://app.asana.com/0/1206821388533283/1207862814593240/f

Customer Flow Onsite will be like so:
    Customer purchases Wristband Ticket Online via Lüp Ticketing Page
    Customer shows their Ticket PDF to onsite staff
    Onsite staff uses ""Advanced Search"" function on Ticket Survey in Lüp App to search the customer's name and find their ticket.
    Onsite staff uses ""Check In"" function
    Replace Ticket Function prompts the onsite staff to scan a SMART QR Coded Wristband to link a physical wristband to the customer's registration.
    Customer's can then scan the qr code on their wristband to register themselves

NOTES:
    Replace Ticket Function needs to work with SMART QR Codes
    Replace Ticket needs to work with UNREGISTERED Tickets

Steve said that ""it might be an issue with outlook"" but he's looking forward to find fix on our end. 
Two issues:
    Confirmation banner shows wrong size on outlook. I did multiple testing and show the screenshot to him too.  Can confirm that banner sizes are correct

Please see screenshot below:

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1208545178811560

2. This relates to the extra bullet showing on the exhibitor invite email. Again, I have tested this via xporience and admin, can confirm that extra bullet does not show. I have send Steve screenshots, he believed that this might be an outlook thing again.

If someone has a respective ticket for either of the events, then they need access to both events. Please note that all cat lovers ticket needs to be co-located to Dog Lovers.

Dollar amounts should not be included. All tickets to be transferred across should be no dollars $0.00.

[2410-Melbourne Dog Lovers Festival 2024] - [Event ID https://admin.lup.com.au/Event/EventDetail/2321] - [October 26 and 27, 2024]
[2410-Melbourne Cat Lovers Festival 2024] - [Event ID https://admin.lup.com.au/Event/EventDetail/2236] - [October 26 and 27, 2024]

ie Please push registration data for respective tickets from 2321 to 2236.  This should be sync'd every minute.

Please confirm if this pushes updates to the opposite event when a ticket is updated
If a pack is updated
If badgelines are updated
If a name or email address is updated
If a ticket is cancelled
Client wants this data to push as soon as possible pre event for reporting purposes
It is likely that we need this to work (or it could just be this runs manually the day before the event and every morning of the event to cleanup the sync data?). Move this part to another card if necessary - https://app.asana.com/0/profile/1203021254617429 this has been copied from a recent co-location card presume this is still needed?

Someone has a $2000 PLATINUM pass with 100% off promo code so they pay $0

They go to Addons/get to select free sessions.

It tells them they need to spend $2000 to complete (ie pay for the original platinum pass) even though the addons are free

Is there any configuration change we can make to alleviate this or this is how it is ?

We will be printing ALL badges from Console, by downloading the mobile colour badge pdf template from Customer Service

Card for logging badge printing from console
    Printing colour badge or plastic badge from console should insert into log table (like we existing do when printing from admin)
    As well it should isnert in to the Answer table for the correct survey (eventparameter or event field??)
    It should say in the AnswerDetails field for 'Method' it should tell us which type it was. eg ""Manual - Plastic' or ""Manual - Colour Badge"" so we know which badge type it was
    If forgot to setup the survey, then we can still find from the log table


Accreditation badges printed from Admin:
    Can we bulk insert that in to Answer table?
    Keep this query handy to run at end of show

Console customer service needs to show 'printed' if the badge was printed on that survey

We want to log the badge print Console, add info to this survey: https://admin.lup.com.au/Survey/EditSurvey/52313 so we can run a back office attendance report using this survey as normal.

Logging data is based on printing:
    Colour Badge

    VisitorFirstName
    VisitorLastName
    Company
    Position

I think that's it.

But because the word merge doesn't support dynamic font sizing, we encounter issues when the name is long or company is long.

I propose we keep these existing four fields but also create new ones:

    Long_FirstName
    Long_LastName
    Long_Company
    Long_Position
    Med_FirstName
    Med_LastName
    Med_Company
    Med_Position
    Short_FirstName
    Short_LastName
    Short_Company
    Short_Position

If FIRSTNAME or LASTNAME are more than 20 characters then these are populated
    Long_FirstName and Long_LastName
    Empty: Med_FirstName,  Med_LastName, Short_FirstName, Short_LastName

If FIRSTNAME or LASTNAME are between than 12 and 19 characters inclusive then then these are populated:
    Med_FirstName,  Med_LastName
    Empty: Long_FirstName and Long_LastName, Short_FirstName, Short_LastName

If FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME are both less than 12  characters   then then these are populated:
    Short_FirstName, Short_LastName
    Empty: Long_FirstName and Long_LastName, Med_FirstName,  Med_LastName

Company and Position we will do the same.

This means that on the template, we can set larger font for the shorter names, and smaller font for the longer names.  It will also help the ticket PDF for print at home badges.

Ideally there is event parameter for specifying the 12 and 20 character cut off values.  And separate parameter for Name, Company, Position

And separate parameters for Plastic Badge and Colour Badge
eg perhaps

PlasticBadgeFieldLength_Name: 12, 20
PlasticBadgeFieldLength_Company: 12, 20
PlasticBadgeFieldLength_Position: 12, 20
ColourBadgeFieldLength_Name: 12, 20
ColourBadgeFieldLength_Company: 12, 20
ColourBadgeFieldLength_Position: 12, 20
TicketPDFFieldLength_Name: 12, 20
TicketPDFFieldLength_Company: 12, 20
TicketPDFFieldLength_Position: 12, 20

That way we can customise it for Ticket PDF's as well (particularly Print at Home Badges) and also the plastic badge and colour badge

    Downgraded (might be Active or Cancelled)
    Cancelled (ie cancelled but no rejected or downgraded log)
    Approved (ie it has approval in logs and is active)
For cancelled, it might have been previously approved or downgraded, so we need to show both the words of 'Approved' and the fact that it is now cancelled. 

I think we tweak it to this format:

EventCode: TicketProductCode - LogDate (or TicketOrderDate if no LogDate): TicketStatus (Approval Status by Username)
    TicketStatus: 
        If either Order or Ticket is Cancelled then show Cancelled
        Verification, Active, Cancelled would generally be the values
    Approval Status:

There are reporting implications with these SMART QR Codes, and using the REPLACE TICKET Function.

For the SMART QR Code Export, we created NEW Packs & Products because we only needed 3 sets of QR Code ranges to print on the 3 wristband categories (screen, music & games) as we have multiple packs/products for different sales online but they are all for the same 3 categories.

When we do Replace Ticket, we do not want to lose the original pack & product value in reporting.

FOR EXAMPLE: If I purchase https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketProduct/EditTicketProduct/35733, when I arrive onsite, the onsite staff will use replace ticket to assign the https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketProduct/EditTicketProduct/37175 QR Code to my registration.

    GALA xx needs to be shown if:
        There is a GALA addon for that ticket that is active; or
        There is a separate GALA ticket with the exact same firstname + lastname + email
        NOTE: xx is the table number that has been allocated

We have 2 different roles needing different access.

To do this we need to tidy up the ADMIN permissions, so that the SHOW CSV and SHOW FINANCIALS Admin permissions are effective in admin/organiser screens

Specifically:
        In ADMIN a user is added
            User is linked to SXSW (not to Lup/ExpoNews)

As we are using console & admin for badge print, is there a way we can create a limited access for our staff to be able to perform their roles without having access to all of console and admin?

Neeshil note: In Console, we would, at best, be able to have them edit those key badge/contact details, no police check needed.  For admin, we would restrict that to only a selected handful of operators, and we would need to discuss police checks/permissions etc.
    In Admin: Allocate them to SXSW client code

CONSOLE: #2 Badge Print
    In Console, if you have the 'Customer Service' role on that Client (ie SXSW), then we want them to have the ability to
        Add/Edit Photo (This is already done separately)
        Edit First Name, Last Name, Company, Position, Mobile, Email (Show the shortcode, productname (non editable) when on this edit screen)
        As Lup Badge print staff, I want the ability to update these details, so that the visitors badge details are correct
            Note, if they only have Customer Service permission on SXSW, they should NOT see any sales reports, numbers or widgets related to sales/attendance etc..

As we are using console & admin for badge print, is there a way we can create a limited access for our staff to be able to perform their roles without having access to all of console and admin?

Context: Neeshil note: In Console, we would, at best, be able to have them edit those key badge/contact details, no police check needed.  For admin, we would restrict that to only a selected handful of operators, and we would need to discuss police checks/permissions etc.

The client would like to promote to existing badge registrants (exclude wristbands and volunteers) to Addon to a Platinum Upgrade pack for $400. So this new Addon does not show for new registrants during registrants the plan is to move the existing badge purchasers to another pack as per the below 4 x new packs:
Tech & Innovation Badge (pre-show) https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketPack/Edit/56756
Games Badge (pre-show) https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketPack/Edit/56757
Music Badge (pre-show) https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketPack/Edit/56758
Screen Badge (pre-show) https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketPack/Edit/56759

An auto-script to run that after a new badge is purchased, their pack gets changed automatically to the new Badge (pre-show) - As listed above

These new 4x (pre-show) packs would be linked to the new platinum upgrade add-on.
Addon
Platinum Upgrade (Special) https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketPack/Edit/56760

If the registrant has the new Platinum upgrade add-on then their main pack/product it auto-changes to a new pack product called Platinum (Upgraded)
Platinum (Upgraded) https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketPack/Edit/56761

For the Talent and Media upgrade to Platinum with this addon, we need to move them to 
Talent - Platinum (Upgraded) not just the standard Platinum (Upgraded)
https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketPack/Edit/56817 
Media - Platinum (Upgraded) not just the standard Platinum (Upgraded)
https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketPack/Edit/56818
 
Queries: Discussed
    check existing coupon codes used won’t affect addon
    check API implications
    Can we return the pack back it's original one post-show? (Unless it was upgraded) I'll create another Dev Card if we can.

Pre-pop Addon Links
After change has been implemented please export file of pre-filled Addon Links with all the registrant's details and include the pre-pop url in this format https://tickets.lup.com.au/AddOn/Get/2420?qr=999999999&email=email@example.com
I will send this file to client so they can send out the Email and links.

We might need to export again a new list of only new registrants after this list pull so they can send again email and links.

Any queries please let me know.

The Cat ticket purchased via the Dogs site (50% off ticket) are scanning fine on the entry scanner. Goes green ""VALID"" and it says the correct ticket pack/product ""(50OFF) (CAT) Adult - Sunday). However, it says ""unregistered"" and does not come up with ""Alex Test"" as it should. (Images One and Two)
Same thing as above happening at Dog Lovers, with Dog tickets purchased via Cat ticketing page. They are coming up ""Check ticket day"" even though the entitlements are set up for all day Sunday - but we can override this for now and I can look more into it later if I have time. Staff will be told to ""Allow Access"". (Image Three)
My concern is that it says ""UNREGISTERED"" and whether this data will show in the organiser CSV or not. I know Mono said it will be fine in above message however I have tested the ticket at a lead scanner - in the notes section on the device, the name does not appear but shows some sort of longcode. In Console, it says ""0"" scans for today and when I downloaded the CSV file for them, the ticket does not appear even though the ticket is valid for the Dog Show. (Image Four and Five)
Just a note (I want recorded) - the banner images for the ticket pdf ticketing set up have been very confusing for staff onsite. So the first image below is Cat ticket purchased via the Dog page so it has a dog image banner, when it should have a Cat one

I want to easily know if I approved this registrant last year
So that I can more quickly and effectively process approvals

For security approval events such as AMDA and IMARC, many visitors return year on year.

It would be useful for the security company, when viewing a person this year, to see a summary of what their previous registrations (for this client only), if they were rejected or approved.  (Note only for registrations that were actively went through approval process. If it was 'active' because they were an import or didn't require approval process, don't show this)

It will match on Firstname + Lastname + Email

AND/OR the face signature of this registrations photo vs ANY registration in the system for that client - we should show the approval status for previous years, and also highlight if the name or email is different. To assist with security process. (Can be separate card if need be)

Also it should show if there any from this year approved or rejected as well.

    1) Rename this to Print (Plastic)
    2) Create a new one for Print (Colour Badge)

Print (Plastic) should
    If the product has a specific Plastic badge template set, then use that, otherwise fall back to the Event specifiic plastic badge template (mobile PDF template)

Print (Colour Badge) should

    Organiser has ability to upload a new photo for a registration (I believe this is already done?)
    Visitor can either upload a new photo to replace a photo in an existing registration, or visitor uploads a photo for a registration that previously didn't have one.

This card is for hte 2nd one

This came up  with IMARC and also I know it's something we've wanted previously re:AMDA

Can we have a method for visitors to upload their PhotoID after registration?

eg these scenarios:
    Scenario 1: We may receive registrations via API and they don't have photos attached.  And want these people to now come back and upload photos
    Scenario 2: Registrations via an Import, and don't have photos, but we want to email them to ask them to upload the photos after we do the import.
    Scenario 3: A sales team may register visitors directly (with organiser ticketing, or a shortened registration form, that does NOT ask the photo to be uploaded at time of registrations), and we want those registrants to securely upload photo ID later after the sales team has registered

I would imagine something like:
    Tag a ProductQuestion (?????) that Photo question is upload later not on initial registration

We require the ability to manually upload an image to an active registration in Admin.
Currently there is no option to upload an image after the time of registration.
The organiser will be providing lists to upload which we may upload images of photo ID against at a later date.
It also gives us the option to override an existing image if required.


----------------------------------------

→ add a Photo to any registration once they have registered; even if they dont already have a photo uploaded
    Currently it's giving error on Accreditation approval page, recrop/upload photo if photo doesnt exist yet. The expected is to enable ReCrop page to upload a Photo even if it doesnt have existing one.

This layout was agreed by the client to be the only layout they would use at all of their events and would not be customised.

I'm not sure what has happened, but the layout has been adjusted since and is now different to the agreed layout.

My theory is that whilst trying to make the Print@Home Badge layout match the Onsite layout, it has been tweaked.

The issue is Steve ordered badge artwork for all events earlier in the year based on those badge specs and now the onsite badge layout is too spread out and prints over the artwork.
I have attached the original spacing for the layout from 2311 IndoPacific.

Printing begins next Wednesday 28th August, so ideally if layout is updated by COB Monday, then I can test on Tuesday.

The team then manually downloads the CSV file from WIX and enters one by one in to Admin.  This is a slow and tedious process which is burning up time for our team.

    We want a more effective way to create orders and surveys and users and sending logins

For this first milestone, all we are interested in is to import the file as an order in admin and future milestones can create the surveys, users and logins.

Importer as first step, not API integration
Should this be automated via API?


Milestone 1:
    1. Go in to Console
    2. Select Scanner Orders
    3. It should list the scanner orders that are currently in the event
    4. Import button - that allows uploading or download a sample template
    NOTE: Import template as per Dev teams requirements
    5. Strict validation on fields (like visitor importer)
    Populate EventOrder table, EventOrderProducts, Surveys table
    The rest of the process can be done manually by Sales team
    Survey: Create them all as DeviceMode specified in the import CSV file
    6. Show a completion page/ finished page

Sample Import CSV file:
    OrderDateTime
    OrderTotal
    Contact Firstname
    Contact Lastname
    Email
    Mobile
    Company
    Tax Number (eg ABN) - Optional
    Stand number

Here's what their 3rd party is saying:

I've attached three files, each of which are tied to their named widgets. The Login Widget code will be key here. Essentially, the code is checking the type of ticket that the user has when they reach that first page. If they are a Speaker or Exhibitor, they'll then (from that point on) only see widgets for those respective groups. Everyone else will default to the current Attendee experience.

When we had the initial tests, Ingo isn't there since we know that Ingo will not be used for AusFitness Expo (consumer event) but unsure why this is showing to all the Expo tickets.

Lup sells stuff to exhibitors, 
exhibitors get emails & phone calls from a bunch of dodgy people trying to sell them things,
We want to have the look and feel be similar to ticketing for the event they are going to so they know they can trust lup.

Example https://admin.lup.com.au/Order/GetOrder/home-show-syd-2023?e=1

Therefore We want a ui with the following

Layout shared with all pages. 
    Same Black header bar as ticketing
    Same header image and background image ( this app can talk to expo so we can pull the images from the db)
    A center white col
    Must be mobile friendly eg at a certain width that makes sense then swap to single col

Landing page 


We need the landing page to have to put the following on the page, as seen above the props have html and need to render it inside of the colum 

    EventOrderHeaderTitle
    EventOrderHeaderBlurb
    A nice modern form to collect the customer info & select which products with name and EventProductDescription (bonus points if we can use the twillo phone input)
    EventOrderTerms (in an accordion that defaults to closed)
    EventOrderFooterBlurb

Products will need to be broken up by section but we need to wire it in

Badge Logic
If a Trade Visitor or Defence Visitor have the conference Add On, then they convert to a Delegate.
This works fine if process via the online page.

If I manually add the conference Add On in Admin via ""Add Pack"" then this logic does not work as expected.

In my 2 examples of a Trade Visitor & a Defence Visitor, the records do not convert to Delegates, and the conference text diplays.

As a console user, I currently have the ability to Filter Products.
I required the ability to SAVE my preferred selection of events. 
If I untick specific events or specially ticket to include them, I want my last selection of products to be Saved for my next visit to console.
When products are filtered there should be an indication that a filter is in place. (See design with Roz).

The Filter Products at the top of the Event Landing page should apply to the following reports in console:
WIDGETS: Attendance, Sales, Tickets
GRAPHS: Total Sales
TABLES: Sales Summary


With the filter encompassing multiple linked years, I would like it to be VERY CLEAR that at the top we have the current Event and below the line is for the Sales Year on Year comparison.

Seeking your help for the below event.

Event Name: https://admin.lup.com.au/Event/EventDetail/2434
Event ID: 2434

The event registration setting is set to Reguired1 except the https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketProduct/EditTicketProduct/35951 which the client would like to require all to register. However, whenever we do a test and select multiple GA tickets, whatever ticket I select after 3 Day pass will force me to register. 

In this case it is Ticket 3 - GA - Adult - Friday, then skipped registration for the 4th ticket which is GA + Tasting Glass - Adult - Friday  and goes to payment.

I also have tried selecting a different Ticket type and figured out any ticket selected after the 3 Day Pass will be asked to register.

I checked GFW Sydney and it's the same case as Brisbane.

Currently ExpoDB is our source of truth
We sync via ExpoBridge data to console's data store

This sometimes is inconsitent. We have no proactive way to check these.

Can we formulate a plan and method of how to do this, without smashing CPU?
eg perhaps it can:
     run every minute on just a few records at a time
    Only run on active events that are selling or running (and for 2 weeks after event)
    Pro-actively surface these issues 

First cut should be:
    An events surveys, questions and options, so that we know exhibitor scanners are set up properly

Next one would be:
    Visitor data pushing through to campaign service (and universal reports)

Future:
    Ticket order/ticket data etc etc
    Sales data

Would we know in advance the barcodes that will be assigned to all badge holders? We will need access to this to supply to Ticketek for separately ticketed affiliate events so our badge holders are able to redeem their spot as this is a part of their badge holder benefits

Q. Do we need TicketIdentifiers?
A. 

Q. How would this work for distinguishing between ONLINE vs ONSITE tickets?
A. We need to create new products for onsite, and set up ticketidentifiers for this range

Q. What do we need for onsite registrations?
A. Create dev card for custom onsite registration form like Rotortech / Indian which uses default pack & product (onsite registration) and asks the question ""which badge type?"". The answers are : Platinum, Music, Screen, Games, Tech & Innovation and converts the registration into this pack/product. [insert dev card from rotortech]

Hey Team

I have a fun one for us. 

In regards to badges (both printed and PDF tickets/P@H badges), if someone has a ""conference"" addon, and they are holding a Trade Visitor or Defence Visitor product, the Badgeline 1 text needs to change to be the addon badge text.

If they have a conference addon, and for example a ""contractor"" product, then the badgeline 1 text should remain as detailed for the Contractor product. 

    Defence Visitor + Conference (addon) = DELEGATE (and do not show Delegate in badgeline 2)
    Trade visitor + Conference (addon) = DELEGATE (and do not show Delegate in badgeline 2)
    Defence Visitor + not having a Conference (Addon) = DEFENCE
    Trade Visitor + not having a conference (addon) = TRADE
    CONTRACTOR + Conference (addon) = CONTRACTOR etc

Any other addons should appear on the badgeline2 as per normal.

Endpoints for Opt-out is a:
/GET that takes a hash of the touchpoint (sms, email) that returns an enum of unknown/allowed to send/do not sent marketing communication/do not send any communication.

/GET/{clientid} (FOR A CLIENT) that takes a hash of the touchpoint (sms, email) that returns an enum of unknown/allowed to send/do not sent marketing communication/do not send any communication.

/POST/UPSERT/{clientId}

This endpoint takes the touchpoint hash and sets the communication flag, we might need logic to manage whether the user is allowed to opt-in/out for that touchpoint.

For auth, endpoint /GET and /GET/{clientid} is anonymous so we enable thirdparty services to easily integrate with us where they are unable to create an oidc client that can auth against us.

For additionally security, we could also require them to hash the touch point and the client id when sending the /GET, but this may not be necessary.

Hello Google Analytics user,

On July 1, 2024, Google Analytics 4 properties will have fully replaced Universal Analytics properties, https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5rtGcRcP1e349njNYythWVW1TORWPkoqjt-KVcazcuGMtb9pujqEXIVNamFPkk7sayzII3-RwmJz2QI1m26dXiYipsgjD-aoyC_YK6ZHPIr53uvmf-KDVUls09_YYnsY3ZNZFBnm-9ynVIKjcIyX_TSz-XWCqwgku0VIb4ApHwifR61Rev_H3Mo-yjpVHLjKu-WT-ijB64WKD8KnJ8_1raRiU2QMsy2aofRayd9zupZuxZ55Zd23qKySaEXVD7z4wv2kwRXLW6TF1H597Bkqug. From that date, Google will begin turning off all Universal Analytics services and Universal Analytics APIs, which means Universal Analytics properties will be inaccessible through the Google Analytics front-end and APIs. If you haven’t completely migrated to Google Analytics 4 properties, follow https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5pqHhenNqSi4F8fm_FWLhNh5Sp0rMA3zdVn6QzGqhFh6GeyDrsEd5qXiRKPLs7fUnDgrKtazVHRtxQvCKgKGZSySvCOkHDi0tGsVFJvmuWBI_Bl3t3qypcjxNkxqxRA8oiqycfjO_LuwJvOhvOXD148A0W09Eo7PVoPxEnNVmCqhE5eluVOrhVMTX6zQwLwD4kf6qg5p7E0HPDgL1mxB1hmmqLkwHnCXxWwkras4zvhS8DOumOHg0QIs805k8wyrdcPH0X6_NSQRn1ydaZIVHk8sy5PLHm-Ejvh7FifkXy0GSnskMzKwIVCFCCGHUnI3z4 to start making the switch today.
Exporting your data
To maintain access to data from your Universal Analytics property, you should download or export your data now. If this isn’t done through one of the methods provided in the Google Analytics https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5pUbmk1NiLy81nppVYhh7IdgsLtDUL0hV5-fUxMyja2pK8aMIBDOaBxaBuBzHXOcdiY5TkB8Jdf69oFhh-Tc3T5OujvnRXPyda4rTGcA7AWSIlw6_-2UZZ2j0xyKNbl_x8Xeyrt48Tjz1QHMHGL2J0tYbMG3_8lGmID43lKH8btkXLMo0fhLMmTM79DgVat732YRm1aqP0Q8QfA4robteKFIZ_cYn0Cf7kO6A63rLRI5uH_WePsopGrHKlM_oSSR7l1-WNCZyrlOF0bCOIq5t8ETPzmv5XGZwD60XfnE7Zw6cdTN5s0aehvC1fcjlZ2HXuwz7yMsnJV2VjBI9bLurwye7RqoOkPsSuA2Tp9tmRsAe2Jnty5tAA0My94alj5ZYGuZoFe8sSpEC9dPsNY4QjrDse_KwRgYg0Rse14kFU, your data will be permanently deleted by Google and won’t be recoverable. If you intend to use the BigQuery integration to export historical data from your Universal Analytics 360 property, we strongly recommend https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5p5NpgnbERka-fS9hAIez2WBJGlBEBIzggbmSAZNyAhcYt_WOa7g0h7VSCFRfsYUkxbAPscouq75IKhc9P0ZQchVp8EgEYDdjpMVp1NxuSUx8m7yzoQsBiL7aDXwtOSnSXFkp_6QEzoTA5a2y2pUMP6zqNnZ226RqEGVzbiiP0fmf9wFOfQr-jszrLnQztN7BtC9Bu5Swxr7swrhVWXFfPFlE4dhei4rdWL8Qs4Z6BGEKyOBtZjy57cRqUhqvDnXXs4ndXAdNyHWP1UF_EJUlQrYYenKSPevODgsOkj7lrLy7eOdhjrS8xYilUCi_zr9II.

Product integrations
Universal Analytics data and settings accessed or used through advertiser, publisher or other product integrations will be unavailable when services have stopped. For example:
    Universal Analytics goals and ecommerce transactions will stop measuring new conversions, including within linked advertising accounts. This may affect ad campaign performance if those conversions are used in combination with Smart Bidding.
    Universal Analytics audience lists will be closed, which may affect ad campaign media activation and performance.
    API requests related to Universal Analytics properties will fail, including requests for deletion of Universal Analytics data through the User Deletion API. This also means that tools relying on an API, such as Looker Studio, will not show any Universal Analytics data.
    BigQuery export and backfill of historical data from Universal Analytics 360 properties can only be requested up to and including June 30, 2024. Already exported data remains available in BigQuery.
    Attribution Projects that were part of Attribution (beta) in Google Analytics will be deleted.


Sincerely,
The Google Analytics Team

Currently we have a https://admin.lup.com.au/EventParameter/Edit/9949 as an event parameter

We need an override field in the TicketStores table. So if this is populated then use the Store's value. If not then revert back to the event parameters etc.

Meta Tags
https://tickets.lup.com.au/IMARC-2024?cat=CAT-MMCEREG&s=mmce

When I look at the page it has the IMARC data instead of this store's data. Can it be updated?

It should use the Store's header image as the logo, and the current URL as the content, and the Title should be the same as we set for the page title. (This should probably apply anyway even when not in multi-store mode?)

We currently have OAPI which is showing it's age.

We need to have a new version that's suitable to take us in to the next 10 years.

First step is a REGISTRATION end point


    GUID
    Visitor.Firstname
    Visitor.Lastname
    Visitor.Email
    Visitor.Postcode
    Visitor.PhoneNumber
    Ticket ProductCode (New TicketProductAPICode if that exists, else ProductCode)

    Answers

        productType
    atEvent
    TicketStatus
    Longcode (only if event setting is true)
    ModifiedDateTime
    RegistrationDateTime

Questions:
    If a visitor has no tickets, do they still come through? How do we show that
    Registration is cancelled, how do we show?
    Registration disconnected from a ticket?
    Addon is removed or cancelled from a ticket? (ie Might move addons from John to Sally)
    Upgrades, downgrades etc

We won't worry about $$ values etc at this stage, we need to think how we want to best represent that information

No ticketOrderer data either

Similar to OAPI https://oapi.lup.com.au/

NOTE: at this point it would be paginated, list API.  In the future we would do a webhook version of this


OAPI of:
    YES Tickets  - registered and unregistered. Also tickets that were active and now cancelled.
    YES Order information
    YES Transaction Information
    What about incomplete 

This is the API of OrdersAPI, showing:

    Tickets and the registration info (including unregistered tickets) 
        Packs, products (API Specific: Pack_API_code and Product_API_Code (field exists already))
        Questions have (API Specific: Question_API_code (new field and backfill). and Option_API_code (new field and backfill)) 
        Security Approval status etc, and rejection reason
        Unpaid orders should come through .
        Order purchase date

        Promo Codes used

        IsIncomplete (1 hour after order starts, if it's not completed then push it to API as ""Incomplete"")
        Visitor registration information too (if it saves) - is it saving on the way through?
    VERY NEAR FUTURE: Separate end points for: ""As integrator I want to know information about the event setup so that I can prepare the integration""
        Registration Survey details: questions,  options. (with ID's, status, API Codes etc)
        Packs.   Pack is how we sell it
        Products.    Product is what we sell
        PacksProducts: ID's and API_codes and how many of each are sold and availability and stock level/sold out
        Products
            Sold In: (ie packs), Qty of the product, PackProductId, Future: Qty sold
        Events end point

In future, we need to move to a Ticket <→ Order relationship will be many to many
Ticket Order has many tickets
Ticket Order has 1 or more transactions
Transaction has 1 or more LineItems

in essence a Transaction is a different tax invoice

Hey Team,

We have another organiser who would like to use this feature, however they have noticed a couple of key features that they would need to make it work well for them and their team. These requests would also enhance the product for our other clients. 

Below I have detailed the requests, could you please confirm 3 things: 
    Can do we it? (is Lüp happy to do this)
    When could it be done by?
    Roughly how many hours each would take (so we can price accordingly)

Feature requests:
    With the report is it possible to get their category (Badge Text) added in? 
    With the report can we add the date it was added/registered? (TOTxDateTime) 


    NP says definitely not: When you scan the tickets can the scanner tell you their table number? (nice to have) 
    We are planning do this on a separate card:  https://app.asana.com/0/1204858398617913/1206999693158258/f Can we download the seating report, add all the table numbers or change the seat and then you upload them all back in – instead of having to go through admin and assign one by one?

As Event Organiser
When I view my event list I want to see a snapshot of sales $
So that I can see multiple event sales performance at a glance


Let's just hit the database directly every 15 mins for PBC only (client ID = 390)
    Only for events that are finishing in the future or have finished in the last month

Here are queries for total tickets and total $ of packs.  You'll need to create a 'today' version of these.
    Total sales $
    Today sales $
    Total qty 
    Today qty
    ""Today"" means 00:00 eventlocaltime based on TicketOrderDateTime + EventLocalTimeOffset

Then just wire them up into the Event list so only PBC get these numbers.

    IMPORTANT: Event Organiser only for their own event!
    IMPORTANT: That have FINANCE permission on their User->Client permission setting for console


-- active tickets on active orders  for PBC
select tickets.eventID, eventcode, count(TicketID)
from tickets
inner join ticketorders on ticketorders.ticketorderId=tickets.ticketorderID
inner join event on event.eventID=ticketorders.eventID
where event.clientID=390
and tickets.ticketstatus='Active'
and ticketorderstatus='Active'
group by tickets.eventID, eventcode
order by eventcode

-- sum of $ of active ticketpacks on active orders for PBC
select  ticketorders.eventID, eventcode, sum(ticketorderpacks.TicketOrderPackPrice)
from ticketorderpacks
inner join ticketorders on ticketorders.ticketorderId=ticketorderpacks.ticketorderID
inner join event on event.eventID=ticketorders.eventID
where event.clientID=390
 and ticketorderpacks.ticketorderpackstatus='Active'
and ticketorderstatus='Active'
group by ticketorders.eventID, eventcode
order by eventcode




This will rely on ExpoBridge information, so we need universal report to be reliable ? ie we don't want it to hit the ExpoDB directly.

    Total Sales (Qty of tickets) filtered by the 'filter products' saved in the event
    Total Sales ($ value) - filtered by the 'filter products' saved in the event
    Should this be Mains + Extras + Addons? Or just MAINS only, or should it be configurable per event?


Superadmins and Organisers require the ability to see a summary Ticket Sales number and Sales inc Tax on their Events List:
**Must be based on products filtered at Event level**

You are receiving this notification because we have identified that you have one or more Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL database instances running on M4, R4, and T2 instance types. You can disregard this notification if you are no longer running these database instances or have already upgraded them to new generation instance types.

In June 2023, Amazon RDS announced the deprecation of M4, R4, and T2 database instance types on Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL.

Starting March 11, 2024, Amazon RDS will begin disabling the creation of Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL database instances running on M4, R4, or T2 instance types. And starting on June 1, 2024, Amazon RDS will make best effort to begin upgrading MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL database instances running on M4, R4, or T2 instance types to equivalent size M5, R5, or T3 newer generation instance type, if available.

We strongly recommend that you migrate your existing Amazon RDS database instances running M4, R4, and T2 instance types to newer generation instance types before May 31, 2024. You may use the following recommendation:

* Upgrade M4 instance to M5 instance or higher
* Upgrade R4 instance to R5 instance or higher
* Upgrade T2 instance to T3 instance or higher

A list of your impacted resource(s) can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab of your AWS Health Dashboard.

How will my Amazon RDS Reserved Instances (RIs) be impacted?

If you upgrade your instance types that are receiving a billing benefit from RIs, the RIs will no longer cover the database instances and you may see additional on-demand charges on your bill. To avoid this, we recommend the following:

* If you have no RIs, or if your RIs have expired, you should migrate your instances at the earliest convenience.
* If you have active RIs which expire before June 1, 2024, you should wait for the RIs to expire and then migrate your instances. You can then purchase new RIs for the upgraded instance types.
* If you have RIs which will be active after May 31, 2024, you should not migrate your instances. RDS will automatically upgrade database instances and RIs that are active after May 31, 2024.

To seamlessly upgrade your database’s instance type or engine version, you may consider using RDS Blue Green Deployments [1] for RDS MySQL and RDS PostgreSQL. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to AWS Support [2].

However all the scripts aren't firing in time before its redirected so meta isn't registering the purchase data as it redirects before it has the chance.

Chris wrote the documentation at https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/LupEvents/FavoritesManagementAPI/1.0.0#/ and implemented the mock for favoriting in the https://github.com/Lup-Events/Lup.VisitorExperienceService. Now we need to implement it.

        Upsert: You will receive many favorites in one request. Create one documentation per item in the array and use something like to get the IDs for the upsert.
            Instead of using a single getID call, it is recommended to use the get all and then grab the ID if it exists from the set.
            It probably makes a lot of sense to add a bulk upsert to the repository that takes a list of T, and then for each call, store on each, and then only call savechanges once.
    Make sure to use the favorite entity supplied at https://github.com/Lup-Events/Lup.VisitorExperienceService/blob/main/src/Lup.VisitorExperienceService.Web/Domain/Favorite.cs.
    Must have tests.
    Once deployed, perform a performance test, for example, how long does it take to upsert a request with 1, 10, and 100 favs in it.

this from Scott:

Hey https://lupevents.slack.com/team/U086V88UV, for this capacity indicator feature that the SXSW team has asked us for we were wondering if it would be possible for Lup to provide an api route that would return a favourite count for all sessions.  I believe they are going to have ~2,500 - 3000 sessions so it could be paginated if necessary.  If that is possible we were thinking about hitting that endpoint every 10 minutes or so and caching the results on our end.  This way we could flag sessions as ""popular"" or ""hot"" if they have a number of favourites that are near or exceed the capacity indicated on the venue.
from the favourites api document you had sent us previously the response of the users favourites looks like
{ ""favorites"": [ { ""entityId"": ""guId"", ""isFavorite"": true } ] }

Would it be possible to get a route that could return all favourites? with a response something like this?
{ 
  ""favorites"": [ 
  { ""entityId"": ""session1"", ""count"": 10},
  { ""entityId"": ""session2"", ""count"": 33},
  { ""entityId"": ""session3"", ""count"": 2},

Set up here: https://admin.lup.com.au/EventParameter/Edit/10399

However whenever I try to ""resend"" my ticket, it fails (see logs here: https://admin.lup.com.au/Ticket?o=10473727)

Could you please confirm why it isn't sending? I can confirm it sends instantly after the order has been placed.

This organiser is going to be using the Invite Portal and sending out big bulk lists to each guest. 

With this in mind, the user experience of the email is quite harsh on the eyes, and similarly hard for the guest to keep track of. 

Is it possible to also attach the list as an excel file or similar? I am also open to other ideas. Perhaps it takes them to a lup page which shows all the links that visitor has and the registration details?

Steve is wanting to make the API set up a little easier for everyone long term, so this means we need to make some changes to LF first and then life will be easier after that.

Currently with the Nathan API, he sends ua a response code, and then within our products we have the code set up as a direct match and then the ticket drops into that product.

Steve wants these response codes to never enter into our system as they confuse people. 

So instead, he thinks that Nathan API will send the response codes as usual, but instead of mapping them to the code within the product, we should map them to the ProductID instead. 

Below I have listed the response codes with the relevant products below.

    Scanned at entry (already part of attendance)
    Printed badge scanned/looked up on device (already part of attendance)
    Registered on iPad
    Scanned at any exhibitor
    Scanned at any theatre

Hi Team, 

The client has sent through their artworks and I have created the event portal.
Rozuel has designed the Scanning Booth buttons and are meant to turned green after being scanned at a specific station, as the copy states: 

Welcome to The Hutchwilco New Zealand Boat Show! To be in to win the $300K Surtees/Yamaha Grand Prize Package, simply scan your ticket at ALL 6 scan stations. When you have successfully scanned at a scan station, it will turn green. Once all scan stations are green, you're automatically in the draw.

The organiser wants to be able to send a unique confirmation email template for this addon (https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketProduct/EditTicketProduct/34810 ) which obviously because it is an addon, our system does not support.

So to get around this could we please:

Step 1:
    For anyone who purchases a 
        conference addon AND Trade Visitor and/or (Product ID: https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketProduct/EditTicketProduct/34750)
        OR conference addon AND Defence Visitor (product ID: https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketProduct/EditTicketProduct/34771) 
    Please change their product to 
        Delegate (Product ID: https://admin.lup.com.au/TicketProduct/EditTicketProduct/35426) 

Since the event is live, it is likely that this combo will already have been purchased so we will need to update existing orders. Please do NOT email the ticket holders once updated. 

Step 2:
This feature will need to be live and we will need to delay emails from sending for 5 mins (or may be 2 mins is fine) so the system has time to make the ticket changes. 


----------------------------------------

Add Ticketing_Email_Delivery_Delay_In_Minutes eventparam to delay email sending.

TO DO:  apply delay email sending when approving:

Additional request - As this year we are trying to separate the shows is it possible to have an XML link for D&D/GDS (+Atelier Avenue) & AIFF (two separate links). With doing so when I assign the exhibitors to a show using the marketing level would this filter through to the website listing so there aren’t dupes?

Currently OEM has both DD&GD plus AIFF exhibitors listed but informa are marketing them separately (separate branding). There's no separate OEM for their AIFF exhibitors in their co-located event. Any queries please let me know.

When I have data imported
I want the option of it to honour the verification/security approval requirements of that product.

eg in certain events we have certain products set to require verification. When we import, after selecting a pack/product it should automatically set a (changeable) option to be ""Ticket Status"" with options of ""Active - approved"" or ""Verification - approval required"".

So if the product requires verification then auto select the ""Verification - approval required"" option.

Allow the user to change this option if need be (so they can override it)

The Import should then set the TicketStatus as appropriate. (And any other fields related to verification)

    If no pack selected then status can be empty
    Once they choose a pack. itshould update status to be whatever the verification status of the Product is set in TicketOrderProducts table.

The organiser has been sending through many many lists for data imports over the past couple of weeks. However they have since realised that this data most likely included alot of duplicate data of visitors already in the system.

Are you able to remove any duplicate ""visitor"" tickets? 

We will be doing an email ticket resend at 10am, so we ideally want to action this prior please. 

Could you please deduplicate based on matching:
Email
first name
last name
job title
company

Please only remove any duplicates within these 2 ticket types:

Exhibitor purchase HZSV8P
Exhibitor purchase 78JK56
Exhibitor purchase 92SE4R
 
I then proceeded to allocate a delegate name to each of the above and on completion I was required to pay $150 per person to be able to finalise the exhibitor pass registration. I thought perhaps the three person purchase of $450 did not process accordingly as no tax invoice email receipt was forthcoming.
 

 
I now have my credit card statement that shows clearly I was charged for the three individual purchases as per attached tax invoice email confirmation as well as the three ticket purchase:
 

 
Therefore, I am seeking Lup Events to refund the amount paid of $450 at your earliest convenience please.

Right now there are many areas in admin, which require the CSC/CSM to know and use HTML.

Can we instead use a WYSIWYG editor. In the past we may have used an old version of TinyMCE? I'm happy to pay for a licence if that is the good one. Or we can use another one and pay for that.

    Note, it should work fine for other events that just have plain text with no HTML.

NOTE: We will end up putting this extensively through the system so this is a first one and we will test and evaluate how it goes.

We have two competing user stores that commit user changes in bulk. 
→ The raw ApplicationDbContext;
→ The usermanager which is two layers above the raw db context:
   hierarchy is: dbcontext, userstore, usermanager when saving users. 

We are running into race conditions where one store might think a user is created but the other user store doesn't or even the opposite (a user exists but a user store says it doesn't), attempted ""failsafes"" to ensure users are saved has lead to duplicate users being created.

Ultimate fix is to rip out any mention of the raw dbcontext.users and use the context that the usermanager exposes. We will then trigger a user migration so all data is synced and managed using the same db context

As Lup Sales team
When I process an order and create a survey, I want it to auto-detect and update the survey.App and SurveyDeviceMode to the correct one
So that it saves time and mistakes when processing orders

    Order page
    Create Scan
    Include a new field for ""Is LeadScanner App Enabled"" (user editable)
    Include a new field for Survey.HardwareCount and Survey.AppUserCount (user editable)
    Include a new field for Survey.UserDefinedQuestionsCount (user editable)
    Default These new fields based off ALL the products on this order the new EventProducts.HardwareCount and EventProducts.AppCount fields
    REMOVE THIS FEATURE: NOTE: The logic we have for SurveyTitle is that if there is 1 question put a ~ in front of the SurveyTitle.  If there are more than 1 questions put a + in front of SurveyTitle. 
    Select SCAN or SCAN SURVEY based on:
        If it is APP only do it as SCAN SURVEY (devicemode=3)
        If it is HARDWARE then do SCAN or SCAN SURVEY Depending on if 0 questions (Scan) or 1 or more questions (Scan Survey)
            If it is HARDWARE and APP do this same rule too
    If any of EventOrderProducts have 'App' then ""Is LeadScanner App Enabled"" should be ON, otherwise default to OFF
    This should then be the value when the survey is created


Additional tasks
    EventProducts.HardwareCount and EventProducts.AppCount and EventProducts.UserDefinedQuestionsCount
        Add / Edit pages for EventProducts include these fields
        Default to blank
        Validate that must be an integer 0 or greater
        Label: ""Hardware Qty"" and ""App Users Qty""
    Update ExpoService so that Stand number has suffix of [Hx Ax Qx]
        If x is 0 then show it as 0.
        eg   D32 [H1 A3 Q5] would be 1 hardware + 3 app + 5 questions
    https://admin.lup.com.au/Event/EventSurvey/2397  Replace the App column with the H1 A3 Q5
    Edit Survey https://admin.lup.com.au/Survey/EditSurvey/47959

Hey Team

The organiser has a pack called ""MEDIA"", and with this product they ask for the ""outlet/publication"" the media person works for. The organiser would like this ""outlet/publication"" to print on the Media badges in place of the Company. However for all other badges we need to keep company as is. 

Typically we would update the ""SAVE TO"", however in this case it would mean we would have 2 questions with ""company"" in the save to.

Customer data is invaluable and helps provide insights and actionable outcomes for  any Event Organiser.   It feeds into the marketing, cross-promotions and execution of future events.  It is critical to Know Your Customer.   The source of customer data can come directly from prospective visitors (as attendees), from an Organizer's ERP systems or from exhibitors.  
The specific context of an event can alter the manner in which customer data is obtained and how it is used, the constant here is that there is a need for a quick  and self-service function to upload data from an Organiser into the Lüp platform.  

Problem Statement

A common request from customers (Event Organiser) is for the team to upload Visitor and/or Exhibitor Data into Lüp, which has been exported from their own systems.  This process is required when badges or tickets are issued outside of the Lüp Platform and need to be imported in.  Lüp have previously provided an Import function, however this ceased to function in 2022 and has not yet been restored.  Currently, this process requires an Engineer to action the request.  This process is often last minute/ time sensitive due to the nature of Events.  The customer's expectation is that imports can be turned around in 30 minutes to within one hour (amda).  An Organiser will ask for this multiple times (GEFE 2022 recently involved 8 separate imports, Avalon was 50+.)  On average each request takes 30 minutes (provided the data quality is good).
An import process is impacted by Bad Data - poorly formatted Excel Files, unexpected special characters, renamed column headings, file type/size.     
In summary, the process is unsustainable and should transition to a self-service feature managed by non-technical Lüp team members and eventually, the potential for an Organiser to manage the process themselves (self-service). 


Design

Pre-requisites and Requirements
    Data is at an Event level > Organisers Portal

Use Cases

    An organiser needs to get Event, Visitor and/or Exhibitor data into Lüp immediately.
    An organiser may need to bulk update existing information about an Event, Visitor and/or Exhibitor. 
    An organiser may have chosen to switch from another event / ticketing platform to Lüp.
    An organiser may need to  pre-allocate badges or tickets before receiving attendee information.

User Story
AS a Lüp Admin, 
I NEED the ability to upload Visitor/Exhibitor data as a CSV file in the importer template structure, 
With simple data cleansing,
With error handling and exception reporting,
With Batch identification,
SO THAT I do not have to enter Visitor/Exhibitor data manually,
SO THAT the Organiser can be prepared for people to come onsite.

 AS AN organizer,
I NEED the ability to issue tickets originating outside of Lüp 
I NEED the ability to issue and pre-print badges for 
AND I NEED a way to have the data bulk imported into the Lüp Platform, 
SO THAT I can manage my event effectively via Lüp.      

Acceptance Criteria
    A Lüp Administrator can access a clean template for population
    A Lüp Administrator can import/export the following (and potentially more) customer/registration data fields:
        Title / First Name/ Last Name
        Company /  Position
        Email / Mobile number
        Location (Postcode/ City)
        A unique identifier record
        A batch reference
        Ticket Product Name/IDs
        Ticket Pack Name/ID
        Ticket Barcode/ Shortcode/Longcode
        Badgeline free text 1/2/3/4
        Questionnaire responses 
    A way to  manage update record Vs add records?  Avoid duplicates
    Upload Batch tracking - ability to know what was uploaded and when. 
    Note:  Questionnaires will always be custom. 

Solution 

Release 1:
Internal Lüp Admin tool 
    Restore Original Importer functionality (parity)
    Add new Record only
    Select pack/product in dropdown
    Error Handling - failure if invalid information. 


Release 2:
Internal Admin tool continued
    Update Records
    Exception Handling and Exception Report
Extend to Externally facing tool? 

Consider: Simple Vs Beginner functionality.

        Questionnaire responses 
    A way to quickly import known basic information - and store custom information for later use (JSON blob?)
    A way to  manage update record Vs add records?  Avoid duplicates
    Upload Batch tracking - ability to know what was uploaded and when. 

Solution 

Release 1:
Internal Lüp Admin tool 
    Introduce a feature with minimum of parity to original Importer 
    Add new Record only
    Import basic Visitor Table info - store rest for future custom management
    Error Handling - failure if invalid information. 

Release 2:
Internal Admin tool continued
    Handle custom values (outside of standard visitor table info - questionaire answers)
    Update Records
    Exception Handling and Exception Report

In Scope 
    A User-Interface for template download/ upload for complete file.  Preferably in new Architecture.  
    Select pack and product  
    A CSV with fixed headers, flexible content
    Error handling to identify erroneous data (invalid characters, empty rows) 
    Automatically fail and identify error rows  - or an exception report to be returned
    Control post-import actions - do we send a confirmation email? 
    Upload Batch Tracking (successful upload returns a Batch ID) 
    Selective Upload - ok to leave unnecessary columns blank
    IMPORTER ADD and IMPORTER UPDATE RECORD

[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication.]

You are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the AP-SOUTHEAST-2 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024. 

A list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab of your AWS Health Dashboard.

This is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration. If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].

If your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.

To protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the AP-SOUTHEAST-2 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:

First, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].

Second, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].

Third, if you want to use a different CA than the default ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].

For more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.

Please be aware of the following timeline:

1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.

2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the ‘rds-ca-rsa2048-g1’ certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].

3. After August 22, 2024 - ‘rds-ca-2019’ will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.

For more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].

- Should the tickets be emailed to the visitors once imported? - Yes please
- Confirming that they will be imported as Approved tickets - Assuming they were approved in 2023 in your system which they all should be.
- Could you please check the data against the data from 2023 to confirm if you want them imported as approved or not? When the team imports the data the system does not cross check against other events so I would hate to import a visitor as approved if they shouldn't be.

This event is meant to charge $0 for GST. However we didn't override admin and so the tax amount of each pack was left with a $ value.

We have since updated each of the packs to have a $0 tax value, however we do need the report to reflect this also. 

Could you please update the sales report in admin and console so that all tax is $0? 

At this point in time there are 10 paid transactions; so perhaps updating the transactions is the better process here. 

Here is the sales report before we updated the Pack tax amount for reference:

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1206915684774387



My expectation is that the Total remains at $745, however the Ex Tax and Inc Tax be equal.

If you could also run a report to confirm that each pack does have a $0 tax value that would be great; I am worried that 1 pack might have been missed and therefore will cause issues again. This will just help double check the work.

Qualified and Unqualified Permissions

(Open to a name change here)

A Person is a member of an Org and have permissions in that org.
i.e. Manage Users
See Attendance Reports
See Surveys
See financial reports

We can add permissions that are qualified (i.e. specific to an event) or Unqualified (i.e. they have that permission no matter what).
Each person can have a number of permissions, to do an action we can look through their permissions and find a reason to allow them.

Some examples:

Alice works for company 123, who run events

Permisson
EventID
Manage


Attendance Reports


Financial Reports




Alice can do anything for any of the companies events, her permissions are “Unqualified”.

Bob also works for company 123 but is in marketing, and can see attendance reports.
Except on smaller shows where he’s also in charge of the budget.
This company also is an exhibitor at a trade show and Bob is allowed to see survey data.
Bobs primary permissions are “Unqualified”, but he has some permissions where he has a qualification for specific events.


Permission
EventID
Attendance Reports


Financial Reports
993939, 27282
See Surveys




When we edit users, we can use the API from event service to populate the UI, but we only need to store event IDs in identity. That is to say, identity does not need any details about events.

User Claims
When a user logs in, Identity will give them a token with claims.

    Discussion - Should we have a “Manage” permission that encompasses all the others?


Viewing Surveys

This should be simple.
A survey is attached to an event, and attached to an exhibitors Org.

So a user with a See Surveys permission, should be able to see events where the event ID is in one of their active surveys.

Downloading CSVs
This could just be a property on the attachment of a survey to an event.

Use Cases for Console & App (React native App).

Brief:

Build a replacement for the Lead Scanner App* (PWA, not an App).
Build an actual App - React Native
That is aligned to Console in terms of Architecture and Design.
That is a product that will be used by Exhibitors in the beginning.
A possible proof of concept for rebuilding of the Lup App (actual) that is used as a conduit for ticket scanning.
Logging, Diagnostics and Error info is expected to be included - Pinging server = usage statistics.
Authentication through Identity Service is a must. 


In Console
Lup Admin needs:
    Ability to issue 'license'/ permissions to a nominated Exhibitor User (as main Exhib contact - SuperExhibitor/ Exhibitor Superuser vs Simple Users)
    Simple Users would not need the ability to access Console.,


Exhib Admin needs:
    Ability to issue additional users for their Exhibitor Staff for onsite use - users to be authorised by Lup Identity Service.
    Ability to set up their Questions/ Context for the Lead Scanner App  - Stands etc
    Ability to download data (supported through Exhib scans) - with the inclusion of which device & person did the scanning.
    Main Exhibitor contact needs SuperExhibitor Access - including settings and management for themselves and simple users. 


In App
    Authentication via Identity Service for all users
        Users represented by Identify Service email and Nominated name.
    Clear Error Messaging when an issue occurs
    Note taking feature against a Lead
    Q - At what point is a lead Uploaded? How long can an App user revisit the entry for notes?
    Clear indicators of when data is uploaded/sync'd to Lup.
        Does this need to be instigated by a user?
    DO NOT ASSUME THAT INTERNET IS GOING TO BE WORKING> A stable offline mode for when Internet connectivity is low.
        Activate on first time - needs internet - any other time
    If it scans, it get Uploaded - even if unregistered, even if invalid - the server should still receive the data - something.
        do not discard
        Exhibitors like to come back later and add more details later. Need ability the go back on data and update.
    When you scan, you should see all the person's details in the app - want the ability to update. Should it update across lup as a whole if data is updated? NO. 
        IF unregistered scans - give ability to enter contact detail info - MAIN record or in User record only?
    Permissions - if I log onto the app on another phone - it is desirable that I can see everything that I scanned. I should only see my scans, as an Exhibitor support (Vs Admin)
        Which person
        Which Event
    Self cleaning, upload on device.  Keep data on device for as long as you are logged in.
        Load profile and clear someone else's scans. 
        SYNC Before clear out. 
    Question types that need to be supported - free text, notes, radio button and checkbox.  Do not need immediately: date pickers, photo uploads yet. (check samples from database on types of questions and method).


CHALLENGES:
IOS - App store and version - may not work on all of our devices.  NEED TO DEFINE MINIMUM SPEC.
One Device may need to work across multiple Events and/or Multiple Exhibitor Stands/Brands.
    THIS NEEDS TO BE FLESHED OUT https://app.asana.com/0/1203444542847929/list.
Multiple Events, Surveys in Same Event. Co-located.



Neesh's Phased Scope - Tony And Jess feel MVP should be one release with all three functions. 
Two types- Scanning and Scanning with Questions
    MVP: Simple Scanning (Not consumer facing) - no questions.
    Next: Add Notes
    Next Next: Add extra questions.



Scan - surface qualifying questions.


Billing Implications on set-up
    Will we charge organiser or user for each person you add
        Seats or transaction based? Seats/licensing is archaic.

Lüp have introduced a  report which allows Organisers to compare ticketing sales across multiple years or specific Events. 
The Year on Year Sales Report includes a table and a graph to represent a series of Events that are being compared.  In the table each Event has information that confirms
    Event Name
    Ticket quantity sold
    Revenue $
    Qty of Paid Transaction
    Qty of Unpaid Transactions
    
The graph represents the Qty of Ticket Sales (Y Axis) and the historical ‘days out’ from the event (X Axis).  The graph has the function to select specific Products for filtering.  Each event is represented by a uniquely coloured line that charts the ticket sales (qty) per day.

Lüp have introduced a  report which allows Organisers to see their Ticket Sales visualised as a 'heat-map'. 
The map is created by utilising an API service provided by Mapbox that returns the geodata for location (latitude and longitude) and the Postcode from the Ticket Order Details captured at the time of purchase.  This is then rendered within a dynamic map of Australia.

They key inputs for the map are Postcode and Quantity of Tickets sold per Postcode.

Users can zoom in and out on areas within the map to see more granular sales information.

The higher the number of tickets purchased within a local area/ postcode the darker the indicator will be.

If you hover over the Ticket sold locations, you can see the quantity.

Because some of the reports are going to be quite large, we should introduce an async process to build the report in the background and send the user an email with an expiring download link.

When the user clicks a link we should validate it by checking the token (GUID) plus the email address in the link, then serve the XLS file and audit the download.

So we can avoid large storage fees we should also have a scheduled task to clean up old report data.

Q: Can please check the below reporting from https://admin.lup.com.au/Organiser/Report/Ticketing/b69c83a3-cc75-4838-bac8-225ded04ad1f vs. https://console.lup.events/events/b69c83a3-cc75-4838-bac8-225ded04ad1f/sales/salesyearonyear, there is 1 ticket discrepancy. if you check the time in the Console is 3 hours and 1 minute ahead vs. to admin.  Please advise why there is a discrepancy?

Attempts to recreate: 

I just checked now and it is indicating an hour and less than one minute difference, which I suspect could be Daylight Savings related.  Daylight Savings commenced in Australia on 1/10/2023 - Event is in Melbourne, which uses AEDT as opposed to AEST now.   

I also pointed out (in the dev-assist thread) that The date/time also does not count down dynamically on either page, it needs to be refreshed.

Could there also be a time difference caused by the frequency in which the report data is being pulled through to each platform? Ie - it hits Admin slightly before Console?

I was just able to get the different down to 1 hour flat upon refreshing:

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1205646989784292


I just checked a NZ Event:  Seems Admin respects LOCAL time,whereas Console may be on AEST?

    We may have more complicated badgelinerules that are based off multiple steps, not just a simple product → badgeline relationship
    If we upgrade/change a pack/product then the badgelines should change to the new product. This isn't happening
    If we change a product's default badgeline and requeue, then the expectation of users is that this should update all tickets, including imported

Currently the importer adds to MQUEUE https://admin.lup.com.au/MQueue/Detail/10812318
New ticketOrder emails should are sent out via MQUEUEhttps://admin.lup.com.au/MQueue/Detail/10812384

One option would be to include a column for ""Tickets"" or ""Tix"" that shows how many tickets were sold in these packs.  (be sure to count the tickets that are in the actual orders of those packs.

Welcome to Lüp Console.

As part of the Console launch, we have conducted  a migration to a new authentication system, Identity.Lup.  To simplify the experience, all users are required to change their Lüp Admin password when prompted.  (As you are currently logged in to Console and reading this, you have already taken the necessary steps to reset your password.)

Why did we make changes to authentication and build Console?

Previously Lüp has maintained multiple platforms, with unique authentication methods.  This is an endeavour to simplify the experience for all users. Users will now log in to Lüp Admin and Lüp Console with the same credentials. We are now able to offer two factor authentication as an added security feature.

Welcome to Reporting in  Lüp Console.

Lüp Console Reporting is a new reporting platform, built on AWS microservices and introduced to replace Cloud, Stats and Yellow Reporting.  Reporting in Lüp Admin will remain live with the same functionality.

Why did we make changes to Reporting and build Console?

Previously Lüp has maintained multiple reporting platforms, with unique authentication methods.  This is unsustainable, so we set out to simplify the experience for all users and limit the number of platforms and authentication methods.  Users will now log in to Lüp Admin and Lüp Console with the same credentials in order to access Reporting.

The new platform architecture will support our ability to iterate and deliver regular enhancements to our reporting product in Console.

What is available in Lüp Console Reporting?

The information you see  will differ per user type.

An Exhibitor will see a list of events that they have surveys for, along with the Exhibitor Scan summary and records.

 An Organiser will see their list of events Sales Summary, Sales Graph, high level Exhibitor Scan Summary:
 Sales Per  Product
 Sales Per Package
 Sales Per Product Per Day

An exhibitor will only need/have org roles for their organisation (Lup) and is not necessary or required to be apart of the organiser's organisation (Amazon).

What’s an exhibitor (Reporting)


•A user that belongs to an organisation that is associated with a survey.
•The difference is an organiser is associated with the event and gets access to all surveys for that event.
•Surveys in expo include a 1-1 relationship with an event and a client (org).

Problem 1: Disconnect between orgs and events migrated

Our initial implementation for migrating orgs filters out those that have been “deanonymized”

Meaning some orgs that are tied to an event, don’t exist in our current system (this is a problem for staging)

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1204868724415291

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1204868726023537

https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1204868726023539



Solution to Problem 1

Don’t filter orgs and migrate all of them.



Problem 2: Admin relies on forms based auth which redirects all calls to use old login system

    Background Tasks are run from identity service to migrate users and clients.
        These tasks hit an endpoint in exponewsadmin and require
        The usenewAuth feature flag to be turned on in expo so we can auth requests with client credentials flow as well as a deployment to remove a node in web.config which happened when said feature flag is on.
    Problem is we cannot use background migration without turning on new feature flag.
    Node in web.config needs to exist for old login system, but we need away to hit our new endpoint with our new login system.

Possible Solution to Problem 2: 

    Simple api key that we store in id server and exponews that we attach to request and we don’t use client credentials to auth to migration endpoints.
    https://app.asana.com/0/1204335833086515/board enpoint in expo news is called BackgroundMigrationController.
    if you can as well we call into the client and user repos and filter out ""test looking"" data but we need that data specifically for clients in expo so can you remove that filter when you're in there?

remove startswith(""Name"") for clients

    Update hard coded header to show real data.  This same header seems to appear for all Events.


https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1204886663450943





    Breadcrumb should show event name rather than ID

When you select and EVENT, the Event ID is being used instead of the Event Name.


https://app.asana.com/app/asana/-/get_asset?asset_id=1204886663450941




    At this stage, Reports should only be accessible based on a Specific Event. 
User needs to select a specific Event first, then land on the Report Landing page.  Should also have options to access Reports, Importer and future other event level features..

    When I switch between profile/organisations/account they aren’t giving me different URL’s. I can’t link someone directly to the page I’m on.  We need all pages to be directly linkable please.
    SO the way the Report links work here is great:
    These link out to:
    / sales
    / registrations

Navigate to and select additional report types via side navigation and dashboard links for that event: Registration
    Total Registration Count
    Show Answer and statistics of responses (# of respondents and %)
        Onsite and Online indicators from Cloud are good

Note:  STATS, CLOUD and YELLOW all  represent good sources for Registration data.

Additional points:
    SurveyDevicemode will be data input points for certain reports.
         1 = registration
         2 = scan only
         3 = scan survey (ie scan and then ask questions

Notes:
    Reports NOT NEEDED - Stats attendance report Ticketing2/ticketing3 in stats.. let's not bring that across for now. (and hopefully not ever)
        Instead - cloud CONSUMER report - can we better optimise it to run more frequently than every 30 mins. eg every 10 mins? (but in first instance, just bring across what is there now so we can shut off cloud.. and then as a part 2 we can optimise it)
    Packs and Product Grouping  - a function managed via ADMIN with a flow-on effect to YELLOW reporting to filter and simplify report views
    SURVEYS
        different surveys can occur to help facilitate different attendance use cases
            First Day Badge Printing Vs Next Day checkin scan
            Certain entrances may only be valid for certain products - eg VIPs, exhibitors
